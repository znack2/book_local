The journey shows three critical success factors: choosing markets with existing infrastructure compatibility, building local partnerships for regulatory navigation, and treating initial setbacks as learning opportunities rather than failures.

Let's help other businesses! 🚀 I like the idea that my company's experience will be mentioned in your book 📚. So I'll write you some short letters with main ideas, ok? 📝\n\nI'm following the plot as I remember it. If you need any details, let me know. 🔍\n\nAs for me, expanding internationally felt like learning to walk after an injury 🚶‍♂️—challenging, uncertain, but absolutely necessary. The push didn't come from a desire for global domination 🌍 but from a pressing need to diversify and protect our business. With a significant portion of our revenue coming from outside the home market 💰, we had to act fast to safeguard those income streams. The stakes were high ⚡, and the path was uncharted 🗺️.",

I think it'll help the readers to get a clear picture 🖼️.\n\nOur first step into international waters was Kazakhstan 🇰🇿, and it wasn't a random choice. With the connectivity of Visa and Mastercard 💳, it was a logical move to restore payment acceptance for our clients and tap into a market where our competitors were already present. We opened a legal entity 🏢, got the payments flowing 💸, and even attempted to launch a local team 👥.\n\nHowever, the team ended up being a costly lesson in resource management 💸, teaching us the importance of due diligence in hiring 🔍. Despite this, Kazakhstan became our financial bridge 🌉, allowing us to pay for essential services abroad (Zoom, Intercom, Figma, any other service - everything developers need 💻) and keep our operations running smoothly ⚙️.\n\nKey Insight: Kazakhstan was our financial lifeline 🆘, enabling us to bypass restrictions and maintain our international operations.\n\nExecution: We quickly found local partners 🤝 to guide us through the process, set up a legal entity, and connected with a local bank 🏦.\n\nLesson Learned: A bad hire taught us the value of thorough vetting 🔍 and the high cost of mismanagement 💰.",
