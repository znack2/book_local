      "body": "Regarding your inquiry about our initial market selection approach, our journey was quite distinctive as we bypassed the traditional path of starting in our home market 🌍.\n\nWe actually conceived the idea for our predictive analytics technology about three years ago while working at an advertising agency 💡. After testing it with the agency's clients and confirming it worked effectively, we left to create our own company.\n\nOur market entry was somewhat chaotic at first, driven primarily by my existing network of contacts 🤝. We focused on reaching out to founders and marketing directors I already knew in European companies. This approach allowed us to secure our first early adopters while we continued refining the product.\n\nWhen considering which markets to prioritize, I focused on three main regions: Europe, the US, and MENA (Middle East and North Africa) 🌐. This geographic focus was primarily determined by my existing network and the fact that over 70% of our clients were companies using mobile apps to attract users across America, even though their legal entities were mostly in Europe.\n\nThe language barrier was another consideration 🗣️. Since we didn't have team members fluent in languages like Portuguese or Spanish, breaking into markets like Brazil or Mexico presented additional challenges. I approached market selection very pragmatically - leveraging existing relationships and language capabilities rather than conducting extensive market research to determine the \"optimal\" location.\n\nOnly later did we develop a more systematic approach to market targeting 🎯, focusing on specific verticals where we had successful case studies (gaming, food delivery, e-commerce retail, beauty/fashion, and fintech) and targeting companies investing between $25,000-$100,000 monthly in advertising channels with mobile apps using Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs).",

Let me share that journey with you 🚀.\n\nOur approach in the beginning was heavily reliant on my personal network - what I call \"networking traction\" 🤝. This pre-launch phase lasted about two and a half months while we were simultaneously finalizing the product. I reached out to founders and marketing directors I knew personally, pitching our solution directly to decision-makers.\n\nInterestingly, about 80% of my initial contacts were already at the LPR (Legitimate Purchase Representative) level, meaning they had decision-making authority to purchase our solution 💼. This significantly shortened our sales cycle as I didn't need to navigate through multiple layers of an organization. My established reputation in the industry played a crucial role - these individuals trusted that even if we didn't deliver immediate results, I would work to ensure they received the value I promised.\n\nIn some cases, we needed to engage with user acquisition managers rather than the marketing directors I had relationships with 🎯. Additionally, our early integration process required access to companies' backend systems, which created security concerns for larger organizations. Once we established official integrations with platforms like Appsflyer and Adjust, this process became much smoother 🔧.\n\nLooking back, I would advise any B2B company launching internationally to monetize from day one rather than offering free trials, especially if the product isn't perfect 💰. This approach ensures you're building based on what customers will actually pay for rather than what you think they need.",

There's one significant misstep that stands out from our early days that I'm happy to share 😅.\n\nAbout two months into our launch, I decided to accelerate our growth by bringing on two external partners to help with lead generation 🤝. One specialized in email outreach, while the other focused on the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) market. Their job was straightforward: generate verified leads that could be converted into sales.\n\nDespite investing two months and considerable resources, neither channel produced a single sale 📉. While they provided various explanations for the lack of results, the bottom line was that outsourcing this critical function simply didn't work for us.\n\nWhy did I choose to work with these particular partners? The decision was primarily based on strong recommendations from someone who had successfully built a similar business model 💭. The recommendation was so compelling that I dismissed other options without proper evaluation. It was a classic case of being swayed by social proof rather than conducting due diligence.\n\nI later discovered that these partners hadn't delivered results for this recommender either 🤦‍♂️. It seems the recommendation was based more on relationships than results.\n\nThis experience taught us that when it comes to early-stage lead generation for a complex B2B product, outsourcing rarely works effectively 🎯. The partners lacked the deep product knowledge and passion that our internal team possessed. They couldn't effectively communicate our value proposition or adapt to the nuanced feedback we were receiving from the market.\n\nAfter this experience, we redirected our focus to building an internal business development team 🏗️. Though it took longer to establish, this approach proved much more effective. Our internal team could deeply understand the product, learn from each interaction, and continuously refine our approach based on market feedback.\n\nFor founders expanding internationally, I'd recommend being extremely cautious about outsourcing critical functions like lead generation in the early stages, no matter how strong the recommendation or how tempting the promise of rapid scaling might be ⚠️.",

This seemed like a logical approach to encourage adoption of a new, unproven technology 🆓.\n\nTo make the initial adoption easier, we offered free trials for the first six months. This low-barrier entry point made it easy for companies to test a technology that could potentially increase their revenue. Our initial product was focused on optimization for Google and Meta advertising, essentially offering a \"money button\" that could improve campaign performance 💰.\n\nHowever, we soon encountered a significant challenge: our solution only worked effectively for about 30% of clients 📊. This led to extended free trials as we tried to demonstrate value, sometimes lasting up to six months. The conversion from free to paid was extremely difficult under these circumstances.\n\nThis experience forced us to completely rethink our approach 🔄. We realized that starting with free trials of an imperfect product was burning resources without generating revenue. Even worse, it wasn't providing clear signals about what customers actually valued enough to pay for.\n\nSo, we abandoned the free trial model entirely ❌. We now sell 6 or 12-month contracts that include our core products upfront. As a bonus, we include our advanced predictive events technology for two months. Clients who see results can continue with the paid version, while those who don't still receive value from our core products.\n\nThis shift to a \"value-first\" approach has improved our business outcomes 📈. We're now building based on what customers are willing to pay for rather than what we think is technologically impressive. The market provides clear signals about what features to prioritize through customers who \"vote with their money.\"\n\nWe pivoted to create a more diversified product suite 🌟. Instead of starting with our most advanced (but less reliable) predictive technology, we developed products that delivered consistent value regardless of the client's specific situation. Our current offerings include AI Predictive Dashboards (analytics that predict future performance metrics), AI Reports (an AI agent that converts natural language queries into SQL for data access), AI Predictive Events (the evolution of our original \"money button\") and our new product AdMaster 🎯.\n\nAdMaster is a platform built for marketing teams who want to quickly pinpoint which elements of their creatives—such as background, text, CTA, or even the presence of people—are truly driving CTR, CPI, and ROAS. What sets AdMaster apart is the ability to instantly generate new, high-performing creatives based on these insights for less than $1 each 🚀. The platform also features a centralized creative management module, allowing you to upload, remove, or organize assets across channels, campaigns, or even specific ad groups — all from a single dashboard.",

Our first company was established in a jurisdiction determined by our investor, who provided the initial funding 🏢. As we expanded, we established additional entities based on three primary criteria:\n\nFirst, we prioritized jurisdictions with favorable tax treatment - specifically those with lower taxes on profits and dividends - to optimize cash flow and reinvestment capabilities 💰. Second, we considered practical feasibility, as not all jurisdictions are equally accessible for company formation. Third, we evaluated client payment convenience, seeking to minimize additional VAT or tax complications for our customers.\n\nFor payment processing, our approach has been relatively straightforward 💳. As a B2B company working with established businesses, we primarily operate on an invoice basis rather than requiring online payment systems. We simply issue bills that clients pay through normal business banking channels.\n\nWhile we initially considered implementing a subscription model through platforms like Stripe, we found it unnecessary for our business model 🔄. Most of our clients commit to 6 or 12-month contracts and pay upfront, making sophisticated subscription management less relevant.\n\nHowever, we did encounter a new need when clients began requesting shorter trial periods of around two months with smaller payments (around $1,000) 📊. For these situations, issuing formal invoices through accounting was inefficient. To address this, I connected Revolution Business, which allows us to generate payment links that clients can use to pay by card directly.\n\nInterestingly, we haven't faced significant payment challenges in the MENA region, where companies like Talabat (a major food delivery service) have had no issues paying through our standard processes 🌍. However, we recognize that certain markets, such as Saudi Arabia, might request localized solutions to support their domestic economy. For significant clients, we would consider establishing local entities if required, though the cost-benefit analysis would need to justify such a move.\n\nOur experience suggests that for B2B services with relatively high contract values, complex payment infrastructure isn't usually necessary in the early stages 🎯. Simple invoicing is often sufficient until specific market requirements or client needs dictate otherwise.",

By the end of the first month, we expanded to four people, six by the end of the second month, and approximately ten within the first five months. This measured growth allowed us to build carefully while managing our burn rate.\n\nOur initial focus was on product development, so our first hires were backend and frontend engineers, machine learning specialists, and a product manager who could coordinate their efforts 💻. This technical foundation was essential for enhancing our predictive models and ensuring the product delivered value.\n\nOnly after establishing this core technical team did we begin building our business development function 📈. This sequencing was deliberate - we wanted to ensure we had a solid product before scaling our outreach. The third stage of our hiring focused on PR/marketing, followed finally by customer success roles.\n\nAfter a failed attempt with outsourced lead generation, we decided to build our internal business development team 🏗️. For a sophisticated B2B solution, we found that internal expertise and passion for the product were irreplaceable.\n\nWhen hiring for business development roles, I looked for several key qualities: experience in digital marketing (preferably with mobile apps), C1+ English proficiency for international client communication (or at least B2 with strong networking capabilities), and either previous startup experience or a clear explanation of why they wanted to work in a startup environment 🎯. An additional consideration was visa status that would allow attendance at international conferences.\n\nWhile we considered hiring foreign talent, we ultimately selected residents with international experience 🌍. This decision wasn't about language preference per se, but pragmatic considerations: candidates from major tech companies like TikTok, Facebook, and Google commanded significantly higher salaries than we could afford as a startup, often had rigid expectations about processes, and typically requested substantial benefits packages.\n\nFor our stage of development, hiring experienced professionals with good English skills proved more cost-effective than recruiting international talent from tech giants 💡.

With European clients in particular, we've had to adopt a radically different approach compared to what might work in home market's business contexts 🇪🇺.\n\nI'd describe this difference through a metaphor: Europeans need to be \"hugged\" before you can do business with them 🤗. By this, I don't mean literal physical contact, but rather a relationship-building process that extends well beyond professional interactions. This includes engaging in meaningful small talk, asking about their personal well-being, commenting on their social media posts, offering genuine compliments, and generally treating them more like friends than business contacts.\n\nThis approach requires patience and genuine interest ⏰. Unlike the more direct, results-oriented business culture where you can immediately focus on product benefits and ROI, European business relationships develop more slowly. You can't force the pace without creating discomfort. I've learned to accept that decisions take longer, and pressuring prospects who haven't responded for a week with multiple follow-ups is counterproductive - it's simply too aggressive for their comfort.\n\nTo navigate this successfully, I've developed specific techniques for transitioning from relationship-building to business discussions 🎯. One effective approach is asking for advice, which naturally steers the conversation toward professional topics. Another is sharing a challenge I'm facing with other clients, which often triggers their desire to help and showcase their expertise.\n\nI've also found that showing vulnerability - something that doesn't come naturally in our business culture where projecting strength is valued - can be extremely effective in European contexts 💭. Admitting difficulties or challenges often creates a deeper connection than presenting a flawless facade.\n\nThese cultural differences extend to our entire sales cycle 📊. While our initial market entry was somewhat chaotic and network-driven, our current approach is much more systematic. We segment by both vertical and geography, focusing on companies that fit our ideal customer profile. However, the relationship-building aspect remains central regardless of how structured our approach becomes.\n\nFor founders expanding internationally, I'd recommend studying these subtle cultural differences in business communication 📚. Technical product expertise alone isn't sufficient - understanding how and when to present that expertise in culturally appropriate ways is equally important for success.",

When exploring a potential vertical in a specific geographic region, we establish clear metrics and timeframes upfront. Typically, we allocate two weeks for initial testing, tracking metrics such as prospect responsiveness, demo conversion rates, and ultimately, contract conversions.\n\nIf the team reports poor results during this testing period, I personally get involved to verify whether the issue is with our approach or the market itself 🕵️‍♂️. I'll select 20 companies in the segment, initiate contact myself, and proceed through the sales process. This hands-on verification is invaluable - if I see positive responses and completed demos, it indicates an execution problem rather than a market fit issue. If I encounter the same challenges as the team, it suggests the segment itself might not be viable for our solution.\n\nWe use specific metrics to make these determinations 📈. For instance, if response rates fall below 7% or demo bounce rates exceed 30%, we typically recognize that the vertical isn't a good fit for our product. These quantitative thresholds help remove emotion from what could otherwise be subjective decisions.\n\nOne illustrative example was our exploration of the EdTech vertical 🎓. Despite conducting meetings with five founders and initially receiving positive feedback, we ultimately generated zero revenue.\n\nThrough this process, we identified two critical insights 💡:\n\nFirst, in EdTech companies, the teams responsible for lead generation and retention are completely separate and often don't communicate effectively. Since our product increases retention through lead generation optimization, this organizational divide presents a structural barrier to adoption.\n\nSecond, we discovered that our technology wasn't well-suited for lead-selling and processing services where human elements play a significant role in conversion 🤝. Our predictive analytics require end-to-end digital lead data, but when human sales representatives become part of the process, the statistical patterns become less reliable.\n\nBased on these specific insights, we made the strategic decision to stop pursuing EdTech companies and refocus on other verticals where our solution could deliver more consistent value 🎯. This approach - testing quickly, evaluating objectively, and pivoting decisively - has been crucial to our international success.\n\nFor founders expanding globally, I'd recommend establishing clear metrics for evaluating market fit early in your expansion process 📋. Be prepared to engage personally when results don't meet expectations, and don't hesitate to pivot away from segments that show structural incompatibility with your solution, no matter how attractive they might initially appear.",

However, about eight months ago, we developed an affiliate program that has proven surprisingly effective.\n\nThe model is straightforward: whenever someone from our network makes a warm introduction that results in a contract, we pay 25% of the revenue for the first three months and 10% for the lifetime of the client thereafter 💰. This typically amounts to $1,500-2,000 per successful introduction - a significant incentive that has generated valuable client relationships.\n\nWhat makes this approach work when our earlier outsourcing attempts failed? The key difference is that affiliates don't need to learn our product or handle technical sales aspects 🎯. They simply make introductions to qualified prospects based on their existing relationships, while we manage the entire sales process. This plays to everyone's strengths - they leverage their network and credibility, while we leverage our product expertise.\n\nWe've kept the program deliberately simple, without requiring extensive training or creating complex affiliate management systems 📋. It's essentially a formalized referral program with generous compensation. The simplicity has made it easy for people to participate without significant commitment.\n\nThis approach has been particularly valuable for accessing networks that would otherwise be closed to us 🔓. While we don't rely on affiliates as our primary growth channel, they provide a complementary source of qualified leads that enhances our direct business development efforts.\n\nBeyond affiliates, we've learned to be strategic about which functions to keep in-house versus outsource 🏗️. Core functions like product development, business development, and customer success remain internal, while we selectively use external resources for specialized services like design, PR, and recruitment.\n\nThis mixed approach allows us to maintain quality control over client-facing activities while accessing specialized expertise when needed 🎨. Our partner (co-founder) handles product strategy and management, while I oversee business development, PR/marketing, customer success, and administrative functions.\n\nFor founders expanding internationally, I'd recommend considering a simple affiliate program as a complement to direct sales efforts, particularly when entering new markets where your network may be limited 🌍. The key is designing an incentive structure that's generous enough to motivate action while ensuring the economics still work for your business.",

My co-founder Grisha serves as the CPO (Chief Product Officer), taking responsibility for product development with our backend engineers, frontend developers, and ML engineers 👨‍💻. He shapes our product roadmap and technology implementation.\n\nAs CEO, I oversee business development, PR/marketing, customer success, and all administrative functions 📊. This division allows each of us to focus on our core strengths while maintaining clear accountability. When it comes to customer-facing materials like presentations, our process typically involves the business development team working with PR/marketing to create initial drafts, which I then review and provide feedback on before finalization.\n\nFor market research and competitive analysis, our PR and marketing team handles these studies, providing insights that inform our strategic decisions 📈. This setup ensures we maintain awareness of market developments without diverting focus from our core operations.\n\nOur development priorities are heavily influenced by customer feedback rather than our own product backlog preferences 🎯. This customer-driven approach has been crucial for our international success.\n\nRegarding our team composition and hiring strategy, we've found that for customer-facing roles in European and American markets, cultural fit and communication style are just as important as technical qualifications 🌍. While our team currently consists primarily of residents with good English skills, we recognize that for certain markets - particularly the US - local talent will be essential for front-office positions like sales and customer success.\n\nThis reflects a broader strategic approach: back-office functions can often be managed remotely by team members from our core markets, but client-facing roles require cultural familiarity and local presence 🤝. As we prepare to expand more aggressively into the US market, we're planning to hire local talent for these customer-facing positions while maintaining our existing team structure for technical and operational roles.\n\nFor founders expanding internationally, I'd recommend carefully considering which roles truly need to be filled by local talent in target markets versus which can be handled by your existing team 💡. This balanced approach allows for cultural adaptation while maintaining operational efficiency.",

Grisha handles all the technical stuff (building the product), while Andrey handles all the people stuff (selling and marketing). They also learned that for jobs where you talk to customers, it's important to hire people who understand the local culture. It's like having a translator who doesn't just know the language, but also knows the jokes and customs of each country."

      "body": "Your question about how our origins have impacted our international business touches on a sensitive but important aspect of global expansion 🌍.\n\nOur experience has been mixed. For the most part, our roots haven't significantly affected our ability to work with clients in our target markets ✅. However, we've adopted a strategic approach to minimize potential friction, particularly when approaching larger international companies.\n\nEarly on, we made a conscious decision to focus initially on companies with local founders or team members operating in international markets 🎯. This approach provided an easier entry point since there was already cultural familiarity and often a greater willingness to work with new vendors that might not have an established international presence.\n\nAs we've built our reputation and developed European case studies, we've expanded beyond this initial focus 📈. However, even now, we recognize that approaching large multinational companies without any connection or introduction can be challenging, regardless of our origin.\n\nWhen it comes to direct negative experiences, they've been relatively rare 🤞. During my previous role as managing director at an agency handling international business, we encountered a few instances where prospects explicitly declined to engage after discovering our connection. With lemon ai, we've experienced less direct rejection, but we have noticed that some larger companies simply don't respond to outreach - though it's difficult to determine whether this is related to our origins or simply normal business dynamics 🤷‍♂️.\n\nThese considerations have influenced our expansion strategy 📋. We've focused on building credibility through results with smaller companies before approaching larger enterprises. We've also been thoughtful about our branding and communication, ensuring our materials meet international standards.\n\nFor fundraising, we have experienced some impact 💰. When raising our second round, some funds declined specifically due to perceived political risks. This reality has influenced our financial strategy, pushing us to focus more on performance and profitability rather than the venture-backed hypergrowth model.\n\nFor founders expanding internationally from countries facing geopolitical challenges, I'd recommend focusing on results and reputation building, starting with markets and segments where your origin is less likely to be an obstacle, and gradually expanding as you build credibility 🚀.",

The American market represents a significant opportunity given its size and the sophistication of its mobile advertising ecosystem. However, we recognize that success there will require a different approach than what we've used in Europe.\n\nBeyond our US plans, we're exploring two alternative approaches for expansion into other regions like India, Latin America, or APAC 🌏. The first possibility is developing strategic partnerships with established companies in these markets. Rather than building our own local presence from scratch, we could leverage partners with existing client relationships and market knowledge.\n\nThe second approach we're considering is a white-label strategy 🏷️. For example, we might provide our technology exclusively to a major advertising agency in India for a defined period, allowing them to sell and support it under their brand. This would give us market presence without requiring direct investment in local operations.\n\nOur decision-making factors for new market entry include 📋:\n1. Existing network connections that could facilitate entry\n2. Language and cultural compatibility with our current team\n3. Market size and potential return on investment\n4. Availability of local talent for customer-facing roles\n\nFor founders considering similar expansion decisions, I'd recommend evaluating whether direct entry is truly necessary or if partnership models could provide a more efficient path to market presence, particularly for regions where building a local team would require significant investment 💡.",

This way, you can grow faster without spending as much money or time learning about each new place."

      "body": "Your question about balancing growth ambitions with profitability constraints highlights one of the most critical strategic considerations in our international expansion journey ⚖️.\n\nUnlike many startups that pursue aggressive growth at the expense of profitability, we've taken a more measured approach 📊. This isn't just a philosophical preference - it's a practical necessity shaped by both our funding realities and the broader business environment.\n\nWhen we first raised capital in early stages, our investor established clear milestones for unlocking additional tranches of funding 🎯. These weren't solely focused on growth metrics but included product development benchmarks, team building progress, and customer feedback quality. This comprehensive evaluation framework encouraged us to build a sustainable business rather than simply chasing user acquisition.\n\nOur approach to new market entry reflects this balanced perspective 🌍. Rather than simultaneously targeting multiple regions with large teams, we've been selective about where and how we allocate resources. For instance, our current plans for US expansion involve a focused approach with a small, specialized team rather than a massive market entry.\n\nThis performance-oriented mindset extends to how we evaluate opportunities 🔍. Before fully committing to a new vertical or geographic market, we conduct limited tests with clear metrics and timelines. This allows us to make data-driven decisions about where to focus our limited resources.\n\nWe've also been pragmatic about team growth, adding roles sequentially based on clear business needs rather than hiring ahead of revenue 👥. This approach has kept our burn rate manageable while ensuring we have the capabilities needed for our current stage.\n\nThe benefit of this balanced approach is resilience 🛡️. While we may not capture market share as rapidly as venture-backed competitors pursuing a \"blitzscaling\" strategy, we're building a sustainable business that doesn't depend on continuous capital infusions. In today's funding environment, where venture capital has become more selective, this approach provides security and independence.\n\nFor founders navigating international expansion with limited resources, I'd recommend adopting a similar performance-oriented mindset 💡. Focus on proving your model in one market before expanding to others, use partnerships to extend reach without proportional cost increases, and prioritize initiatives that drive revenue rather than just growth metrics.",
