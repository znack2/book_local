Unlike many companies that deliberately target international markets after establishing themselves domestically, our experience was somewhat unique - we never had any particular focus on the home market at all, despite being founded there.\n\nOur journey actually started much earlier, around 2004, when I began exploring this field as a hobby. My interest was piqued when social networks emerged and it became clear that platforms like üì± VKontakte (Facebook equivalent) contained more data than many intelligence agencies had in their closed databases. As üìò Facebook and other networks expanded globally, we recognized the immense potential of working with this open data.\n\nWhat's fascinating is that we experienced a form of \"accidental internationalization.\" We created a unique product that worked with open data intelligence, and once we made it available through the right channels, customers started coming to us from all over the üåç world - regardless of our location or origin.\n\nTo illustrate how geography-agnostic our growth was: by 2018, the üá∫üá∏ US tax service was paying $20,000 annually for a subscription to our service. They were fully aware we were IT specialists creating innovative technology, and it didn't matter - they valued our product's unique capabilities.\n\nThe lesson here is powerful: when you create something genuinely unique and valuable, your country of origin becomes far less important than the quality of your solution.",

Rather than burning through cash on a custom UI, we made a strategic decision to leverage an existing platform.\n\nWe identified üîó Maltego, one of the leaders in the investigative field, as an ideal partner. They had an internal data hub - essentially a marketplace for data sources - where we could list our service. This decision proved transformative. Our first customer, a üá™üá∫ European police officer, found us through this marketplace and paid us $100 - our very first revenue.\n\nThe beauty of this approach was that it immediately gave us üåç global distribution with zero marketing spend. We didn't need to worry about regions or countries - we simply offered our solution through a platform that already had worldwide reach. This partnership continued to be our primary source of customers for several years.\n\nThis experience taught me that for many companies, especially those with limited resources, entering international markets through the right partnership can be incredibly effective. This doesn't just mean finding resellers - it means integrating with platforms where your target users already exist. Today's equivalent might be building on üí¨ Slack, üìä HubSpot, or various cloud marketplaces where customers can discover your solution regardless of where you're based.\n\nOf course, there's risk in being completely dependent on a single channel. While we initially received 100% of our leads through this partner's marketplace (we didn't even have our own website until later!), we gradually reduced that dependency. Today, only about 5% of our leads come through this channel, as we've developed multiple marketing approaches of our own.",

Instead of targeting markets geographically, we oriented our entire strategy around use cases and roles.\n\nOur hypothesis was simple but powerful: if a professional role exists with specific use cases and tasks, and if the number of these professionals worldwide is substantial, then we should focus on solving their problems - regardless of which country they work in or whether they're in government or private sector.\n\nThis approach was partly born of necessity - we simply didn't have the resources to pursue multiple geographic markets simultaneously. But it proved remarkably effective. We identified specific roles (like procurement specialists who need to conduct company due diligence) and focused on solving their pain points. The beauty of this approach is that a procurement professional's core needs are remarkably similar whether they work for üì± Samsung, a üè® hotel chain, or a government agency in üáÆüá© Indonesia or üá∫üá∏ America.\n\nThe results speak for themselves: today we have customers in more than 85 countries. This üåç global footprint wasn't achieved through carefully planned regional expansion, but through addressing universal professional needs.\n\nLooking at our current customer base, approximately 60% comes from B2B and 40% from B2G (government). However, in revenue terms, B2G represents 70-80% of our business because government contracts tend to be larger. This distribution wasn't strategically planned - it emerged organically as we followed customer demand.\n\nWhile we're now beginning to develop more segmented approaches for specific industries and regions (particularly focusing on B2B and the üá∫üá∏ American market for our next growth phase), the use-case approach allowed us to build a global business with minimal resources in our early years.\n\nFor startups with limited resources, this approach offers a powerful alternative to conventional geographic expansion. By solving a specific problem extremely well, you can attract customers from anywhere in the üåç world.",

My partner and I were both employed full-time elsewhere, and we funded development from our regular salaries. We had some early success, with customers finding us through our partner's marketplace, but we treated it rather casually for the first three years.\n\nA personal tragedy became the catalyst for change. In 2018, my original partner suffered a fatal blood clot. This shocking event forced my remaining partner Andrei and I to make a decision: either commit seriously to growing this business or let it continue as a side project indefinitely.\n\nWe chose to go all-in. Both of us had experience in large multinational companies - I had been responsible for working with the financial sector across multiple countries in my previous role. We divided responsibilities clearly: Andrei would focus on technology and product, while I would handle sales, marketing, and PR, which had been my passion for over 20 years.\n\nFrom 2019 onward, we began building a proper company with structured approaches to market segments, sales channels, and growth strategy. The results have been impressive: we've averaged 70% year-over-year growth and expect to finish this year with approximately $6.5 million in ARR.\n\nThis growth hasn't been without challenges. We raised our first investment round in November 2022, securing $4 million. Like many startups, we increased spending based on projected growth that didn't materialize as quickly as expected. By December 2023 my partner decided to leave the company. Instead of giving up, I spent the next year rebuilding the company. This marked the third time üîó SocialLinks nearly collapsed, but my commitment to building a billion-dollar platform kept me going.\n\nThe journey from hobby to growth company required us to formalize many aspects of our operation. We started with just direct sales for the first few years. Eventually, I realized we needed proper marketing to scale further, which led to several iterations before we found effective approaches. More recently, we've launched an affiliate program and tested over 100 marketing hypotheses, ultimately identifying 3-5 strategies that continue to perform well.\n\nOur growth required operational changes too. I vividly remember the moment when inbound inquiries became so numerous that we couldn't respond within a day - that's when we hired our first employee, whose sole job was handling these requests. She's still with us today as a director.",

By 2021, we began exploring investment options to accelerate our expansion.\n\nInterestingly, investors approached us rather than the other way around. These conversations pushed us to develop more structured thinking about market sizes and growth strategies. Until then, we had been largely opportunistic in our approach, following customer demand rather than pursuing predefined market segments.\n\nOur first investment round closed in November 2022, when we raised $4 million.\n\nThe investors who ultimately backed us brought more than just capital. Our lead investors - including the founders of üöó Indriver (the ride-sharing app) - had a specific mission to support local entrepreneurs in the international market. They provided valuable guidance on scaling globally, asking the right strategic questions to help us think bigger.\n\nThis mentorship has been invaluable in helping us transition from an opportunistic growth model to more systematic market development. Currently, I'm focusing on strengthening our presence in the B2B enterprise space and building a more deliberate strategy for the üá∫üá∏ American market.\n\nOne piece of advice I'd share with founders seeking investment for international expansion: look for investors who bring strategic knowledge of global markets along with their capital.

Our interface was in üá¨üáß English from the beginning - this wasn't even a conscious choice that required discussion. In the development world, English is the default language. This immediate global orientation made it easy for customers anywhere to use our product.\n\nWe're still primarily English-only today, though we're beginning to consider üá™üá∏ Spanish localization. However, I firmly believe that localization to other languages is not among the top priorities for entering international markets. A solid English product can gain global traction if it solves the right problems.\n\nThe cultural aspect of our journey is equally important. We built üîó SocialLinks as a genuinely global product without any national or regional orientation.\n\nThis distinction became increasingly important over time. When the geopolitical situation changed dramatically in 2022, many local companies faced significant challenges in international markets. However, because we had built a global product and company culture from the start, with customers in 85+ countries and no particular focus on the home market, we were able to navigate this transition more effectively than companies that had to suddenly pivot from a domestic to an international orientation.\n\nOne key insight from our experience: B2B and B2G customers are remarkably similar across countries. Government agencies and businesses worldwide face similar challenges and have similar functional requirements. By focusing on solving universal problems rather than country-specific issues, we created a product that resonates globally.\n\nCurrently, we're considering our next phase of growth, which will include more deliberate focus on specific geographic markets. However, the foundation of our international success was built on creating a universally valuable product rather than tailoring our solution to specific regions.",

This partnership was invaluable in our early days - it gave us immediate üåç global distribution without requiring significant marketing investment. However, relying entirely on a single channel created obvious risks.\n\nOur first marketing expansion was incredibly simple: we created a basic landing page using üåê WordPress, with just a brief description of our service and a \"Leave an application\" button that connected to email. This minimal approach proved surprisingly effective - as people from various communities discovered us through word of mouth and our partner marketplace, they began visiting our website and sending inquiries.\n\nIn fact, the volume of inquiries quickly became overwhelming. We reached the point where we physically couldn't respond to all requests within 24 hours, which led to our first hire - someone dedicated solely to processing these inquiries. It's a wonderful problem to have when you need to hire someone just to handle inbound interest!\n\nAs we grew, we developed a more sophisticated marketing approach:\n\n1. We launched our own standalone product, reducing dependency on our partner's platform\n2. We tested over 100 different marketing hypotheses, ultimately identifying 3-5 approaches that consistently performed well\n3. We established an affiliate program about three years ago, creating additional distribution channels\n4. We began developing more targeted approaches for specific industry segments\n\nThe evolution from 100% dependency on a single partner to a diverse marketing mix took several years. Today, only about 5% of our leads come through our original partner channel. This diversification has been crucial to our resilience and continued growth.\n\nFor companies considering international expansion, I'd recommend a balanced approach: leveraging partnerships for initial distribution can be incredibly efficient, but you should simultaneously build your own marketing channels to reduce dependency over time.",

      "body": "As we wrap up this overview of our international journey, I wanted to share some key lessons that might benefit other entrepreneurs considering global expansion.\n\nFirst, building a global product doesn't necessarily require a traditional country-by-country approach. By focusing on solving universal problems for specific professional roles, you can attract customers worldwide without needing a dedicated strategy for each geography. This approach is particularly valuable for resource-constrained startups.\n\nSecond, partnerships can dramatically accelerate your path to global markets. In our case, integrating with an established platform immediately gave us worldwide distribution with minimal marketing investment. Look for platforms where your target users already exist - whether that's üí¨ Slack, üìä HubSpot, ‚òÅÔ∏è AWS Marketplace, or industry-specific solutions.\n\nThird, start with üá¨üáß English. While localization may eventually become important, an English-only product can achieve significant global adoption if it delivers unique value. In our experience, English was sufficient to build a customer base across 85+ countries.\n\nFourth, be opportunistic but strategic. Our early approach followed customer demand without forcing predetermined geographic priorities. This allowed us to discover where our product had the strongest market fit without wasting resources on markets that weren't ready. As you grow, you can gradually shift toward more deliberate market development.\n\nFifth, understand that B2B and B2G needs are remarkably similar worldwide. A procurement specialist, security officer, or financial analyst has similar core requirements whether they're in üá∫üá∏ America, üá™üá∫ Europe, or üåè Asia. This universality creates opportunities for global solutions.\n\nFinally, resilience is essential. üîó SocialLinks nearly failed three times throughout our journey. What kept us going was a combination of passion for our mission and conviction in the massive potential of our platform. Building a global company is inevitably challenging - the ability to persist through setbacks ultimately determines success.\n\nWe're now preparing for our next growth phase, with a more deliberate focus on the üá∫üá∏ American market and enterprise B2B customers. But the foundation of our success was built on creating universally valuable technology that transcended geographic boundaries from day one.",
