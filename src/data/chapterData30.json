      "body": "In response to your question about our company's origins, I'm happy to share our story from the very beginning.\n\nWe started MD in 2016 with a fundamental observation: while information technology typically makes processes more efficient and less expensive in most industries, healthcare seemed to be the exception. When IT enters the medical field, treatment costs often increase dramatically - sometimes by factors of tens or hundreds. 🏥💻\n\nOur mission became clear: use digital technologies to increase the capacity of existing healthcare systems. We chose to focus on neurology, where specialist shortages create long waiting times that can lead to irreversible consequences for patients. 🧠⏰\n\nOur first product was a rehabilitation service for stroke patients during the outpatient stage. We implemented this within both public and private clinics at home. The solution was a web platform that processed human behavior using artificial intelligence components, allowing patients to receive effective rehabilitation without leaving home. 🏠💪\n\nThe platform included several key modules:\n- A computer vision system that analyzed and corrected a patient's movements 👁️‍🗨️\n- A speech recognition module that could assess not only what was said but how it was said - including pace, type, and speed of speech (even damaged speech) 🗣️\n- A cognitive rehabilitation component that selected appropriate exercises based on the patient's condition 🧩\n\nBy 2021, our system was functioning very effectively, particularly after COVID accelerated interest in telemedicine and online rehabilitation. We became one of the leaders in this field in home market, collaborating with top private medical institutions like EMC, MIC-SIS, HADASSA, Medscan. 🚀\n\nA turning point came in mid-2021 when we noticed a concerning pattern among stroke patients - many exhibited suicidal tendencies. This led us to expand our capabilities to analyze psycho-emotional states, including depression, anxiety, and suicidal risk. When we integrated this functionality, the system worked even better, as we discovered that some cognitive issues were actually consequences of poor emotional states rather than neurological damage. 💡\n\nThis realization broadened our vision beyond stroke rehabilitation to three directions: restoration of lost skills due to illness, preventive medicine, and developmental medicine. We also began addressing mild cognitive impairments (MCI), often associated with aging. 🌱",

We were at the peak of our influence in digital neurology rehabilitation and had presented to investors, structuring an investment round at home with a signed memorandum. 📈\n\nThen February 2022 happened, and everything changed. We lost our investment round and realized we needed to focus exclusively on revenue-generating activities. On March 3rd, I received notice that my Latvian residence permit was frozen. Our Latvian company, registered in my name, began experiencing difficulties with banking and counterparties. ❄️💼\n\nWe quickly understood that supporting our European business—which was already generating more revenue than our home operations due to higher European price points—would be impossible under these circumstances. We initially planned a simple separation of these businesses, but complications mounted. 🌍💰\n\nEuropean regulatory requirements led us to focus exclusively on rehabilitation and MCI, with our broader brain health initiatives temporarily frozen. We were simply finalizing our remaining contracts at home with the intention of eventually moving the entire team to Europe. 🏢➡️\n\nBy November 2023, we found a legal solution that allowed us to maintain both our local and international operations. Today, we operate through a distributor for medical rehabilitation in American and European markets, while our home entity handles prevention and developmental medicine in B2C, B2B2C, and B2B segments. 🤝\n\nJust this week, you'll see news in Forbes and other media that we've raised $2.2 million to enter the MENA (Middle East and North Africa) market—also operating through our local entity. 📰💵",

However, there was a significant hurdle: the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), which can be extremely challenging for medical startups without stable cash flow. 🇺🇸🏛️\n\nIn 2021, the FDA hadn't yet established clear protocols for medical software, meaning solutions like ours would be classified as devices. This classification entails a lengthy, nurturing, and—most importantly—expensive certification path. 💰⏳\n\nOur strategy became entering the European market first, where the EMA (European Medicine Agency) offered some regulatory relief compared to the FDA. This would allow us to generate consistent revenue that could then fund our FDA certification process. 🇪🇺💡\n\nBy that time, we had already participated in numerous international competitions, particularly in Finland 🇫🇮, Sweden 🇸🇪, and the Netherlands 🇳🇱, which had raised our profile and built valuable connections. When we decided to establish a Latvian company, it was primarily for practical reasons—Latvia offered the easiest and most affordable path to EU residency, allowing us to conduct business throughout the European Union. 🇱🇻\n\nRegarding Asia, we never considered it a core target market. The region has a high prevalence of alternative medicine practices rather than the evidence-based approaches our technology requires. Singapore was the only exception, but it's prohibitively expensive for business operations. 🇸🇬💸\n\nWe found competitions to be an efficient way to gain visibility. They provided access to concentrated groups of specialized professionals, decision-makers, investors, and clinic directors. Winning these competitions helped establish both our medical credibility and our technical expertise, positioning us as a strong tech company in the healthcare space, not just a medical service provider. 🏆🎯",

Medical projects rarely enjoy \"cheap traffic,\" which is why many healthcare startups focus exclusively on B2B with larger contracts and lower marketing needs. 💰📈\n\nTo evaluate acquisition costs, we ran test advertising campaigns through Facebook Ads and Google Ads, analyzing click costs by country. We also tested different product positioning for different markets. For example:\n- In the United States 🇺🇸, messaging around **memory improvement** generated the strongest response\n- In Europe 🇪🇺, **\"active longevity\"** messaging performed exceptionally well with our product positioned as a solution to slow brain aging 🧠⏳\n\nThis market-specific research prepared us for targeted approaches in each region and informed our overall expansion strategy. 🎯✨",

Saudi Arabia offered significant advantages - certification obtained in the United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪 or Saudi Arabia would be recognized in Europe under a facilitated program, potentially simplifying our European certification process. ⚡🏥\n\nThe primary barrier preventing us from choosing MENA over Europe was language. Adapting our product to Arabic presented substantial challenges. For us, localization isn't simply a matter of translation - every assessment and development methodology must be rewritten in collaboration with doctors to function properly in a new language. 🔤👨‍⚕️\n\nSince English remains a common language among expats living in MENA territories, we decided to focus on English-speaking Europe first. Our plan was to develop our core product there while gathering insights that would help us adapt for other markets later. 🌍📈\n\nWe are now considering other regions like Latin America, given that Spanish is the second most common native language globally. However, we evaluate multiple factors beyond language, including the penetration of evidence-based medicine, subscription payment habits, and cultural receptiveness to our service model. We carefully weigh all these elements before committing to specific market entry. 🌎⚖️\n\nFor our product specifically, we discovered an important cultural insight: because we offer personalized meditations for mental health, we needed to be sensitive to Islamic perspectives.

We successfully met this deadline, and the revenue we subsequently generated through our Cyprus operations was sufficient to keep the company viable. 🇨🇾⏰\n\nFor our European operations, we pursued a purely B2B strategy, working through a distributor model. We engaged a European company with European leadership and personnel, granting them exclusive distribution rights until summer 2025. This arrangement allows us to focus entirely on product development while they handle market distribution, with the distributor receiving a discount on license costs. 🤝🎯\n\nInterestingly, this partnership came from a connection we had established back in 2020, when this distributor had shown interest in our rapidly growing business. At that time, we declined the partnership. In 2022, when circumstances changed dramatically, we reached out to them and proposed collaboration. 🔄💡\n\nPreviously, we had preferred direct sales to clinics, working through personal connections with clinic owners and paying only one-time small percentages for introductions. The distributor model required sharing ongoing revenue, which initially seemed less attractive. However, when our passports became problematic for business development, working with established European partners became our only viable option. 🏥🌍",

Our goal is to prepare the market for eventual B2C offerings, but we recognize this will take time. 📈⏳\n\nThe market needs multiple companies with similar approaches to establish a new culture of personalized and online medicine. Companies like **Bionic** and **Genotech** are also contributing to this ecosystem development, but none of us are aggressively pursuing B2C yet due to market readiness concerns. 🏗️🤝\n\nOur market validation process was thorough. We launched advertising campaigns directing to a blank 404 page to estimate potential market value from ad interactions. We collected contact information from interested parties, conducted **200 interviews** with both interested and non-interested individuals, and consulted with Arab medical professionals about the viability of B2C services. 📊💬\n\nThe consensus was clear - the market isn't prepared for direct-to-consumer medical technology solutions yet. We also discovered an important cultural insight specific to our product: because we offer personalized meditations for mental health, we needed to be sensitive to Islamic perspectives. Meditation has associations with Hinduism that could be considered problematic (shirk or apostasy) in Muslim cultures. We adapted by renaming \"meditations\" to \"spiritual practices\" and making appropriate adjustments to content. 🕌💭\n\nFor market research, we leveraged our internal product and marketing team led by **Dima Naumov**, Oracle's former CPO for B2B. We purchased market analyses from research centers like **Markets and Markets** for healthcare spending trends, finding it more cost-effective to acquire these specialized reports than to conduct this research ourselves, particularly for healthcare systems where data is often behind closed sources. 📋💡",

      "body": "I want to address your question about our **$2.2 million funding** for MENA expansion and how we determined this amount.\n\nOur original financial plan was to use funds from our European company to enter the MENA market, but after our European investor placed restrictions on this approach, we needed to seek alternative financing either at home or MENA directly. MENA became our focus. 💰🎯\n\nThe core funding requirement was calculated at **$2 million** - a figure based on supporting a dedicated MENA team for one year in the most pessimistic scenario (no revenue generation by summer 2025). The additional **$200,000** came from a business angel who aligned perfectly with our values and vision, and to whom we sold a small equity stake. 👼💼\n\nOur financial planning for MENA follows three key milestones:\n1. **Register companies** by the end of Q1 2025 🏢\n2. **Establish a functioning B2B model** with product-market fit in Saudi Arabia by the end of Q2 📈\n3. **Expand to North African countries and the United Arab Emirates** by year-end, achieving product-market fit in these regions within the B2B segment 🌍\n\nWe're deliberately approaching B2C cautiously, focusing on building the necessary infrastructure and market awareness before fully committing to direct consumer offerings. 🏗️⏰\n\nThank you for your interest in our international journey. I'm always happy to share insights from our experience, as I understand firsthand the challenges of entering new markets. 🌟🤝",

This pessimistic planning meant they had enough money even if everything went wrong. When raising money, always plan for bad scenarios, not just the optimistic ones."
