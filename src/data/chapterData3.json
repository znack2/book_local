      "body": "You asked about when I first considered expanding internationally, particularly about that \"Britanka (British Higher School of Art & Design)\" I sold. 🎓\n\nThe truth is, I never had a specific moment when I decided to \"go international.\" I had always worked with international connections and partnerships, even when my core business was bringing British/international education to the homeland. I never felt limited to the local market, despite having my clients, money, and structure there. 🌐\n\nI was already living across multiple countries simultaneously, with various side investments and businesses in the UK. So there wasn't a clear moment when I woke up at home and suddenly decided to try something abroad. It was just a natural feeling that large-scale opportunities existed in other countries. 💡\n\nEven before exiting the British Higher School of Art & Design and Universal University, I started exploring different hypotheses, calculating various models and business plans. I leveraged my connections with influential people, investors, and started testing ideas through meetings. Eventually, I connected with Brazilians and investors with interests in Brazil (in areas like fast fashion, refurbishing and resale of pre-owned phones, etc). 🤝\n\nAfter conducting deeper market analysis, I saw interesting educational opportunities in my area of expertise. A concept emerged to build something based on high international education standards, applying insights from my accumulated experience. I didn't specifically target Brazil - it was a combination of individual circumstances and connections with people who had experience there, including our partner from Argentina who had lived in Brazil for 2 years. 🇧🇷\n\nI eventually exited my home project and relocated to Brazil. ✈️",

Brazil represented a very large market with clearly defined problems. It's similar to other developing economies in some ways. 📈\n\nAsia seemed more complicated because it's mentally and culturally very different from European culture, making it harder to establish a foothold. Latin America felt more accessible mentally while still offering great prospects. 🌎\n\nMy choice was significantly influenced by my personal connections and feelings about potential collaborations. I had conversations in different places, and Brazil clicked - I could envision what we might accomplish together. 💭\n\nPersonal preferences played a major role too. I needed to be physically present in whatever country I chose, spending significant time there. For example, I wouldn't consider Nigeria despite recognizing it as a rich, powerful country - I had no connections there and serious concerns about safety and security. 🛡️\n\nBrazil, despite some external perceptions about safety, has a completely different reality than what many assume. It was simply more aligned with my preferences and vision. ✨",

His credentials spoke for themselves. Our third partner (who later left) was a prominent Swiss investor with projects in Brazil and elsewhere. I had also invested in some of his projects. 💼\n\nEssentially, I applied a due diligence process similar to KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols. I examined what these potential partners were doing and who they represented. This verification process is necessary at all levels, even with less high-profile partners - you need to investigate their activities and conduct reference checks. ✅\n\nCould I have moved to Brazil without such partners? There are countless paths to achieving business goals. You can try it yourself - come to a country, talk to people who live there, build trust, make friends, and explore possibilities together. This approach might lead nowhere, or you might meet your ideal partner at the first meeting. The process is unpredictable, but you must be prepared for various outcomes. 🎲",

Rather than formal research, I focused on direct conversations to learn about the market, key players, operational dynamics, and opportunities. The market volume data was relatively easy to find, but the deeper insights came through interviews and networking. 💬\n\nI organized many meetings with people who might provide valuable perspectives. There was nothing particularly unique about this approach - it was standard market investigation through direct engagement. 🤝\n\nThe entire research and preparation process took about ten months before launch. During this period (roughly 2015-2016), I was constantly traveling between countries - living \"on airplanes\" ✈️ for about three years, splitting my time between the UK, Moscow, Brazil, and other locations. I would stay in Brazil for varying periods - a week, two weeks, or a month - then leave and return.\n\nI maintained this international presence while ensuring I spent enough time in Brazil (about 48% of my time) to avoid visa issues. While some aspects could potentially have been managed remotely, my physical presence was crucial for establishing corporate culture. 🏢\n\nThe process of creating a corporate culture doesn't happen overnight - it requires forming a core group with direct involvement from founders/leaders. This culture needed to be transmitted from the top down, supported and reinforced over time so the initial team and subsequent hires would understand, accept, process, and eventually pass it on. Like a ship needing both sails and a rudder ⛵, my presence helped steer the company in the right direction.",

We received support from home and found local agencies in Brazil through our networks. We hired an operations director and local IT specialists for infrastructure. 💻\n\nEvery project is unique in its staffing needs - whether you're launching a SaaS service or a processing plant, requirements differ significantly. Our approach focused on testing the market with sufficient resources to determine what budget, timeframe, and team would be needed before scaling up. ⚡\n\nImportantly, we didn't set a strict 10-month deadline with plans to abandon the project if unsuccessful. This was a committed offline business venture that required continued forward progress regardless of initial results. 📈\n\nWe began by calculating our business model and searching for appropriate facilities. This involved renovation work, preparing promotional materials, marketing campaigns, and hiring sales staff. We engaged PR agencies to make initial announcements, and then focused on renovating premises while conducting parallel recruitment and launching online advertising through agencies. 🏗️\n\nWe opted for agencies rather than immediate hiring because it was faster, though not necessarily easier. Speed was a priority for us. When we didn't have our own people with local market expertise, using agencies was a practical first step rather than immediately building an internal team. 🚀",

      "body": "You asked about mistakes we made when first entering Brazil, and there were certainly some valuable lessons learned. 📚\n\nOne significant oversight was insufficient research into structured holding companies. This area is crucial as it can either save or cost substantial money 💰. We relied on a locally-recommended company for registering and managing international entities, who advised us to use Malta as our jurisdiction for entering Brazil. They cited benefits like double taxation agreements, but this proved to be problematic.\n\nMalta turned out to be an extremely expensive jurisdiction - everything from registration fees to mandatory audits for public companies came with high costs 💸. This arrangement made sense for large businesses with substantial backing, not for our relatively small operation. We failed to approach this recommendation critically, resulting in significant administrative and audit expenses being drawn from our accounts.\n\nWe also encountered hiring challenges. There were many \"posers\" in the market, and we had to later correct mistakes made by our team members who didn't always treat shareholder money with appropriate care. While they weren't deliberately careless, they sometimes failed to recognize problematic deviations from standard practices. 🚫\n\nFor instance, we were unprepared for Brazil's exceptionally high social taxes and severance requirements. When terminating employees, we discovered they received not just one or two extra payments but sometimes five - a shocking revelation about local labor practices! These were normal practices in Brazil that no one specifically warned us about because they're considered standard locally. 😱\n\nWe gradually corrected these issues as we learned more about local operations. It's worth noting that salaries in Brazil are relatively lower than in America or Europe because companies pay approximately 70% on top in various deductions, resulting in a comprehensive social package despite lower base compensation. 📊",

There was a large segment for additional professional education conducted offline (now primarily online) at home. The model which we used at home relied heavily on weekend classes - specifically Saturdays - where people would dedicate entire days to study, consistently attending from morning until evening throughout the academic year for one to two years. 📅\n\nThis model failed completely in Brazil, where Saturday is considered sacred personal time! 🙅‍♂️ While Brazilians might occasionally attend weekend sessions, expecting weekly commitment for several months proved too demanding. We had to restructure everything to weekday evenings instead.\n\nThis reflects fundamental differences in work-life balance perceptions. My countrymates typically take fewer vacations (partly due to climate limitations) and don't mind dedicating Saturdays and evenings to education. Brazilians have different motivations and priorities, so we had to adapt our product characteristics and training periods accordingly. 🌴\n\nThis was particularly relevant during our offline period - our subsequent online transition changed these dynamics again. 💻",

Sometimes this involves structured testing like A/B comparisons, other times it involves launching new formats based on intuition about what might work. We also rely on data analytics from our Learning Management System to identify improvement areas and allocate resources accordingly. 📈\n\nRather than isolated experiments at specific moments in time, we embrace an iterative improvement process through ongoing experimentation. It's difficult to single out one particular lesson that made the most difference, as our progress comes from consistent, cumulative improvements. 🔄\n\nWhen we expanded to Mexico in 2021, we applied a quick-validation approach to test the market 🇲🇽. We found a capable country manager and provided her with a budget to replicate our successful Brazilian products for the American market. This expansion coincided with our rapid growth period - we grew from zero to $20 million in revenue in just two years (launching officially in mid-2020, reaching approximately $12 million in 2021, and $20 million in 2022). 💰\n\nThe Mexico expansion ran parallel to our Brazilian operations, using the same platform. We simply needed to develop courses in Spanish, create landing pages, and establish basic support infrastructure while student numbers remained manageable. 🛠️\n\nOur focus on Latin America was strategic - my Spanish language skills, regional connections, and the cultural similarities made it a logical extension. The proximity also helped, with flights between countries taking a few hours. ✈️",

Instead, we calculated specific requirements: salaries for team members, development costs for the first ten courses, and marketing expenses for a six-month period. The work involved preparing these launches, executing them sequentially, and building marketing efforts in parallel. 📋\n\nOur organizational structure was quite efficient - our performance marketing team, platform team, and localization efforts operated concurrently. The expenses for the Mexican team specifically weren't very large, as they primarily focused on product creation and initial customer support (essentially one manager). The majority of our budget was directed toward marketing, which provided transparent analytics tracking sales volume and spending efficiency. 📊\n\nRegarding mistakes in Mexico, there weren't any major Mexico-specific errors. Our challenges were more global in nature. During our period of aggressive growth (when investment capital was relatively accessible), we spent liberally to fuel expansion - a reasonable strategy when companies are primarily evaluated on growth rates 📈. However, when economic conditions shifted in 2022 (closed borders, skyrocketing interest rates), we pivoted sharply toward profitability, reducing our burn rate while sacrificing growth speed.\n\nBy late 2022 and throughout 2023, we rebuilt the company with a focus on margins rather than aggressive growth, operating with minimal burn rate. This wasn't so much a mistake as a necessary adaptation to changing circumstances. 🔄\n\nMexico essentially followed Brazil's strategic path, with no radically new approaches. All successful tactics reached Mexico after being proven in Brazil, with our Mexican portfolio containing fewer courses - specifically those that had demonstrated the greatest success in our Brazilian market. 🎯",
