      "description": "Mikhail Tolstikhin's systematic approach to getcourse's international expansion demonstrates the critical importance of cultural adaptation and on-ground market immersion in complex B2B markets. Key insights include: the value of comprehensive global market analysis before selecting target countries (50 countries analyzed, 7-8 pilots conducted), the necessity of three-month minimum market immersion for proper calibration of expectations and operations, the challenge of managing headquarters expectations while adapting to local business rhythms, the importance of hiring and training local technical personnel early in market entry, and the recognition that absence of competitors can indicate market education challenges rather than opportunities. Getcourse's Indonesian experience highlights how systematic research and pilot testing can identify promising markets, but success requires deep cultural adaptation, patient relationship building, and acceptance of fundamentally different business operating speeds and customs."

This period coincided with getcourse's increased focus on internationalization 🚀. At the time of our arrival, the company could only allocate minimal resources to international business - perhaps a week of total company bandwidth - and additional resources were needed to move forward effectively.\n\nThere was already some presence in the Brazilian market, with a handful of clients who had organically found the platform 🇧🇷. I was brought in to manage the technical and product components, while Alexei took responsibility for development, growth, and marketing. Given that getcourse is a complex B2B2C platform rather than a simple course-selling solution, my role involved identifying potential technical and non-technical limitations for international expansion.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of potential countries for expansion 📊. From an initial list of approximately 50 countries we kept in mind, about 20-25 were in our long list for gathering preliminary information. Around seven countries made it to our shortlist, where we attempted pilot projects. These pilots helped us confirm that we could develop business in these markets - verifying client interest, user behavior patterns, technical feasibility, and sales potential.\n\nOur market evaluation included several key criteria: GDP (both total and per capita), population size, language groups, purchasing power, cultural factors and many others 📈.\n\nOne approach that proved valuable was examining consumer behavior patterns 🔍. For instance, we assumed that high VOD indicator or streaming service adoption indicated comfort with card payments and recurring subscription models. Also, the proportion of suppliers varies from country to country.\n\nBased on our analysis, we identified markets where we wanted to establish legal entities and others where we preferred to operate without formal legal presence ⚖️. For a complex product like getcourse, this distinction significantly impacts operations - legal entities allow for localized payment systems, while operating without them limits even basic technical capabilities like regional page loading or video buffering.",

        "description": "Mikhail and his team looked at 50 different countries before picking the best ones to try their online course platform! They narrowed it down to 20-25 for basic research, then tested only 7 countries with real pilot projects. They checked things like how much money people have, how comfortable they are with online payments, and whether they like streaming videos. It's like trying to choose the best school for college - you research lots of options, visit a few, and then pick the one that fits you best.

Rather than starting from scratch, he sought out people within getcourse who had both product knowledge and language skills that could support international operations 🔍. He also recruited external specialists with international experience, particularly in technical roles.\n\nBy the end of 2021, our international team had grown to approximately 30 people 📈. This included dedicated teams for various markets - for example, 4-6 people focused exclusively on France and Germany. These European initiatives were ultimately paused when the war began, which is why I sometimes forget to include them in our country count.\n\nWe approached our market research methodically, rapidly progressing through the analysis stage in about three months ⏰. For particularly interesting directions, we brought in interns and students knowledgeable about specific countries - for instance, students from institutes specializing in Asian countries. These researchers conducted in-depth analyses for approximately two months.\n\nMy first international trip was to India in late 2021 or early 2022 🇮🇳. By then, Yulia Ponomareva was already operating there, having been placed in charge after I had initially expressed reservations about rushing into the Indian market. The purpose of my India trip was multifaceted:\n- Meeting with clients in person 🤝\n- Conducting live pilot projects 🧪\n- Hosting web events with local participants 💻\n- Demonstrating to potential partners that they would be working with an international team 🌍\n- Building relationships with foundations who could provide valuable introductions 🏛️\n- Meeting with technical integrators and local payment service providers 💳\n\nIt was an intensive 10-day immersion that provided invaluable insights into the market dynamics 📚.",

      "body": "I'd like to clarify our pilot project approach since you asked about this specific aspect of our expansion methodology 🧪.\n\nA pilot project in our context involves partnering with either a local school or an educational provider to launch a course on getcourse in English or the local language 🎓. We identify partners willing to invest their time and ensure adequate market coverage. Through paid advertising, we collect leads that flow into automated funnels and convert into sales.\n\nIf we observe positive metrics, we proceed with further testing 📊. Even slightly negative results can be valuable - they often indicate interest exists but adjustments are needed. After conducting several successful pilots across different niches, we deem a market worthy of further investment.\n\nOnline schools, which were already interested in international expansion, became important pilot partners 🌍. We conducted joint tests in multiple countries, including Brazil and India, though I don't recall if Indonesia was part of those early pilots.\n\nOnce a market shows promise through these pilots, we implement the next phase: finding a local representative who ideally lives in that country 🏠. We typically search through platforms like Upwork for mid-level sales managers (not necessarily requiring a full degree). We train this person about our platform, business model, and startup approach, and then wait for their feedback while providing access to our customer data, partner information, and acceleration opportunities.\n\nFrom our initial long list, we conducted pilots in approximately 7-8 countries 🗺️. Turkey stands out as a market where the pilot results were disappointing, leading us to abandon that market. For most other markets - Indonesia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, France, and Germany - the pilots delivered promising results.\n\nThe pilots with partners in India generated thousands of transactions, indicating significant potential 🚀. While I'm not certain about their current international operations, they were among the few local educational companies actively exploring global markets.",

After successful pilots, they would hire a local person through websites like Upwork to be their representative in that country. It's like testing a new recipe with a few friends before cooking it for a big party - you want to make sure people like it before you spend lots of money and time!"

      "body": "To address your question about our expansion timeline and how we prioritized different markets 📅:\n\nOur initial focus was on Europe, India, and Brazil, with pilots running concurrently in these markets. The subsequent wave of pilots included Turkey, Argentina, Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia 🌍. When the war began and we had to close our European operations (France and Germany), we redirected our attention to developing countries.\n\nThis shift led us to explore additional markets like Bangladesh, the Philippines, Malaysia, and Thailand 🔍. Our evaluation considered numerous technical criteria beyond just market size. For example, Thailand appeared promising from an economic perspective - solid per capita GDP, technological adoption, and digital literacy (even in rural areas). However, its uniquely complex language presented an immediate barrier 🇹🇭.\n\nSouth Korea and Japan were ultimately rejected despite their technological advancement because of market oversaturation 🇰🇷🇯🇵. These markets have long-established local players with entrenched patterns that would be difficult to disrupt as newcomers.\n\nRegarding Indonesia specifically, our serious exploration began in late 2022 with a three-week market research expedition 🇮🇩. The results were overwhelmingly positive, convincing us to move forward aggressively. We established a legal entity in March 2023, just months after our initial visit.\n\nThree main factors made Indonesia particularly attractive:\n\n1. Customer enthusiasm - Potential clients were extraordinarily excited about getting away from WordPress plugins and gaining more freedom and control 🎉. We spoke with over a dozen prospects who expressed genuine interest in our solution.\n\n2. Competitive landscape - The online education sector in Indonesia appeared to be receiving substantial political support and funding, yet existing solutions were providing poor value to creators 💰. For instance, existing referral programs typically offer experts only 5-10% of profits, creating an opportunity for us to introduce a more equitable model.\n\n3. Technical feasibility - Our on-the-ground meetings with banks, payment providers, infrastructure services, and communication platforms all yielded positive responses 🏦. Everyone seemed excited about new market entrants, which contrasted with their typical hesitation toward foreign companies.\n\nThese factors, combined with Indonesia's impressive demographics (large population, average age of 27, high TikTok adoption indicating technological familiarity), made it a compelling market 📱.",

Indonesia also had great demographics - lots of young people (average age 27) who already used TikTok and understood technology. It's like finding a neighborhood where everyone complains about the only pizza place, all the suppliers want to work with new restaurants, and lots of hungry teenagers live there!"

This preliminary work helped form our expectations and identify potential contacts. However, the most valuable insights came from in-person meetings where conversations often revealed entirely new avenues we hadn't considered.\n\nThere's a common Indonesian saying that \"for every 100 yeses, there are 99 noes\" 💭. While we had heard this expression from expatriates in Indonesia, we didn't fully appreciate its implications when building business relationships.\n\nIn Indonesian business culture, people often express interest and agreement because they genuinely want to be supportive and maintain positive relationships, not because they're ready to commit 🤝. Many meetings that seemed productive were actually driven by curiosity about meeting foreign entrepreneurs or the social status associated with business discussions, rather than serious intent to work together.\n\nA telling example: we found an apparently ideal partner earlier this year - a significant blogger with half a million followers who seemed perfectly aligned with our business 📱. Despite our immediate rapport and handshake agreement, it took 68 days before this relationship produced our first client. This timeline dramatically affects projections and planning.\n\nAnother challenge unique to Indonesia is the pace of business operations ⏰. Everything moves exceptionally slowly compared to our expectations. For instance, obtaining a credit card from a bank takes three months, and then at the final stage, you're asked to deposit 110% of the credit limit - a practice standard across Indonesian banks but completely unexpected from our perspective.\n\nManaging these expectations becomes one of the most significant challenges - both for the founder/shareholder deciding to enter overseas markets and for the person on the ground creating expectations for leadership 📈. This constant tension can undermine otherwise promising market entries.\n\nHad we not spent time on the ground in December 2022 and then returned on tourist visas in March 2023 to establish our legal entity, we might have taken the same approach as in India - rushing in without appreciating the market's natural rhythm 🌊.",

Given our platform's complexity, we recognized the need for at least two local technical specialists who could undergo extended training. These individuals would not only support customers but also channel feedback to product development.\n\nWe also transferred sales techniques and objection-handling approaches between markets 💼. While these required cultural adaptation, the core elements remained consistent - education marketing still addresses similar fundamental concerns regardless of location, and money motivates similar behaviors across cultures. We could adapt rather than completely reinvent our sales methodologies.\n\nRegarding market timing and pace, Indonesia proved to be the slowest market we've encountered ⏰. The difference is particularly noticeable when comparing direct communications. When a Brazilian says a process takes a month, as outsiders we might question their commitment. However, when a team member in Indonesia reports the same timeline after thoroughly researching requirements, the credibility is different.\n\nWe adjusted our year-one targets based on the understanding that the customer journey would be different 📊. This proved accurate, and we met our first-year targets. By the second year, however, we encountered deeper challenges around product adoption depth - Indonesian users were utilizing only 5-10% of the platform's capabilities compared to 40% at home.\n\nThis revealed a crucial market difference we hadn't fully anticipated: without established competitors offering similar solutions, Indonesian users lacked context for our product category 🤔. Their extreme caution manifested in behaviors we hadn't seen elsewhere - waiting weeks after creating a page before sending it to ensure it wouldn't disappear, waiting additional weeks before uploading courses to verify content security, and general hesitancy that dramatically slowed adoption.\n\nWhile we had competitors in India and Brazil, Indonesia lacked direct equivalents 🏆. This absence of competition initially seemed advantageous as it indicated an open market, but we later recognized it also meant the market needed education about the product category itself - a much bigger challenge than we anticipated.",

      "body": "Your question about our events-focused strategy in Indonesia touches on a key aspect of our international approach 🎪.\n\nWhen promoting a complex B2B platform like getcourse through advertising, prospects often misunderstood the offering - assuming we were selling courses directly rather than providing infrastructure for course creators 🤔. This misalignment of expectations led to poor conversion rates and occasional refund requests.\n\nEvents provided a superior alternative by capturing attention for 2-3 hours, allowing us to clearly explain that users would be creating their own courses rather than purchasing ready-made content 💡. We could outline earning potential and immerse attendees in the context of the platform, providing physical materials they could share with friends and colleagues.\n\nWe tested this events-focused approach across multiple markets - India, Vietnam, and Indonesia. The results varied significantly by country:\n\n- In Indonesia, events proved remarkably effective as both sales channels and networking platforms 🇮🇩. This aligned perfectly with Indonesia's communal culture, where people typically belong to close-knit groups of approximately 3,000 people (often organized around places of worship). Information shared at events would naturally circulate throughout these communities within days.\n\n- In Vietnam, events generated less direct sales but created more market buzz and awareness 🇻🇳. Attendees treated events more as networking opportunities, and we even attracted press coverage. This created valuable word-of-mouth momentum despite fewer immediate conversions.\n\n- In India, our events strategy was less developed as we entered that market earlier in our international journey 🇮🇳.\n\nThis strategy specifically targeted the segment of our audience that was \"problem aware\" - people who recognized challenges but didn't yet understand the solution 🎯. These individuals comprised approximately 20-25% of our potential audience, with the remaining 75% being entirely \"unaware\" of the problems our platform solved. Through events, we effectively captured this problem-aware segment, achieving up to 10% sales conversion rates.\n\nRegarding outreach and LinkedIn strategies, we found them particularly challenging in Indonesia due to several market-specific factors:\n1. The prevalence of spam has made Indonesians highly skeptical of unsolicited messages 📧\n2. Business communication culture differs significantly - Indonesians prefer discussing business matters in person 🤝\n3. Geographic considerations play a major role - prospects immediately want to know if you have representatives on their specific island 🏝️",

Rather than immediately establishing our own legal entity, I would recommend a longer track of working through local partners first 🤝. This could involve borrowing talent from an established local company and paying accordingly, while avoiding the overhead of creating a separate legal presence.\n\nThe decision to establish a legal entity carries significant implications, especially for a company like getcourse with only 50-60 people at headquarters ⚖️. It diverts substantial resources toward office maintenance, legal compliance, tax filings, accounting, and payroll. Working through partners as long as it remains mutually beneficial would allow for testing the market without this administrative burden.\n\nAnother critical insight relates to market immersion. I believe three months of daily, in-person interaction with clients is the minimum required to properly calibrate expectations and build appropriate operational structures 🏠. From June through September, I focused exclusively on constructing our organizational framework - not because I lacked a vision, but because direct observation of local realities continually reshaped my understanding of what would work.\n\nRegarding local leadership, we struggled to find a suitable Indonesian director who could drive the local team independently 👨‍💼. I filled this role myself while on the ground, but this created a system that couldn't function without me. This challenge stemmed partly from Indonesia's unique business patterns (like Friday prayer schedules affecting meeting times) and partly from the absence of an established industry from which to recruit experienced leadership.\n\nEven when hiring English-speaking Indonesian staff, we observed they typically completed about 40% less work than equivalent teams at home 📊. Cultural factors like deep-rooted mistrust of automation meant that despite training and demonstrations, staff would revert to manual processes they considered more reliable.\n\nThe cultural differences extended beyond business practices 🎭. Our assumptions about influencer marketing, for example, proved entirely inapplicable. We spent approximately 10 months calling, meeting, and pitching revenue-sharing partnerships to hundreds of influencers, ultimately securing only one who dropped out at the contract stage. Indonesian influencers operate almost exclusively on an endorsement model with upfront pricing.\n\nAs I prepare to conclude my journey with getcourse in early February and transition responsibilities to the liquidation team, I'm reflecting on whether Indonesia was the right fit for me personally 🤔. The business environment is so markedly different from what I'm accustomed to that I believe I might perform better in other markets.",
