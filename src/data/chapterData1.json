Let's give it a shot.' **This client relationship became our gateway into the MENA region** 🚀.\n\n**From 2016 through 2017 📅, we operated in 'business trip mode'** - fly in ✈️, meet clients, get briefs, deliver services. It was essentially the same work we did in 🇷🇺 Russia: **content management, design, and 🌐 website support for LG.com**, just for the 🇦🇪 Dubai region. **The 🇦🇪 UAE market was far behind 🇷🇺 Russia in e-commerce maturity**, so we didn't rush into major investments 💰.\n\n**This experience taught us that operating internationally requires local presence.** While we could serve existing clients remotely, real 📈 growth only came later when we established local 👨‍💼👩‍💼 teams and full business development operations.",
