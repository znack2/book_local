Let's give it a shot.' **This client relationship became our gateway into the MENA region**.\n\n**From 2016 through 2017, we operated in 'business trip mode'** - fly in, meet clients, get briefs, deliver services. It was essentially the same work we did in Russia: **content management, design, and website support for LG.com**, just for the Dubai region. **The UAE market was far behind Russia in e-commerce maturity**, so we didn't rush into major investments.\n\n**This experience taught us that operating internationally requires local presence.** While we could serve existing clients remotely, real growth only came later when we established local teams and full business development operations.",

This realization drove our European expansion plans.\n\n**We established entities in Netherlands (2020) and later Dubai (2022).** The lesson became clear: **big clients prefer local partners** due to taxes, VAT reclaim, and regulatory compliance. **Cross-country invoicing is messy** - you need local presence for enterprise clients.\n\n**We launched 10 products; only 4 survived.** But those survivors could scale internationally. In Netherlands, we leveraged our partnership with Hatch (later acquired by American company PricePider). **Europe offered higher purchasing power, average order values, and GMV** - but it was also conservative and competitive.\n\n**Post-2022 invasion, Americans said 'We don't work with Russians' and canceled our contract.** We had to pivot fast. **Dubai seemed neutral** - only 1-hour time difference from Russia, open bank accounts, existing infrastructure. This forced move actually opened new opportunities we hadn't considered.",

I thought it'd be a **U.S. proxy** - I was wrong. **Cultural friction with 'ma√±ana' attitude hurt operations.** Cost: ~$130K, yielded one client.\n\n**Indonesia happened because our Dubai client moved there.** With **270M people and fast-growing e-commerce**, it offered huge potential with low competition.
