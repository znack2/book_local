      "description": "24TLL's expansion journey reveals crucial insights for B2B SaaS companies entering international markets. Key lessons include: Client-led expansion provides the safest entry strategy - following existing clients to new markets reduces risk and provides immediate revenue. Local entity establishment is essential for enterprise sales - big clients prefer local partners for tax, VAT, and compliance reasons. Cultural nuances can make or break business relationships - understanding that 'no' doesn't exist in Latin America while 'yes' is coded differently requires deep local integration. Timezone management becomes critical when operating across 4+ markets simultaneously. Community building and reputation development must be prioritized over direct sales in international markets. Budget allocation should account for 6-12 month sales cycles and higher than expected local hiring costs. The spray-and-pray approach teaches fast but costs significantly - validation before scaling is essential for sustainable growth."

If you have any additional questions, feel free to ask. Maybe our experience will help new founders to avoid some mistakes.\n\nFirst idea of expanding came to us in around 2017. At that point, we were already quite active as an agency working with big businesses at home 🏢, and things were moving along pretty well. Around that time, we started positioning ourselves as \"product and services.\" That is, we weren't just offering services related to e-commerce and design around it, but we also began developing some automation in the form of scripts and so on 🤖.\n\nThese thoughts were, of course, a bit dreamlike at the time 💭. But circumstances lined up—one of our clients was relocated to Dubai (where I am now) 🏗️. I think that was one of the decisive factors. They recommended us and said, \"Let's try something here, because you've been serving us at home for the last five years, and your work is significantly better than what's available locally in Dubai. Let's give it a shot\" 🎯.\n\nSo, we flew over, started testing, and tried working in a sort of business trip mode — fly in, meet, get some briefs, deliver services, and fulfill orders ✈️. It all moved forward in a slow, steady way. It was almost the same work we were doing at home, just for the Dubai region. The client was the same — <a href='https://www.lg.com'>LG</a>. A manager had relocated; he worked at a subsidiary ad agency, and we were subcontractors both at home, and, eventually, in Dubai 🤝.",

        "description": "Sometimes the best business strategy isn't trying to find new customers - it's following your existing ones! Yury discovered that when your best client moves to a new country, they become your perfect ambassador. It's like having a friend introduce you at a new school - they already know you're awesome and can tell everyone else. This approach removes the biggest challenge of international expansion: proving yourself to strangers. Instead of cold calling, you have a warm recommendation from someone who already trusts your work!"

We've launched 10 products; 4 survived 📊.\n\nWhen we pivoted from an agency business to an IT business, I realized the IT side had a foundation for scaling ⚡. That is, you can sell the same product multiple times across different markets. It can even work remotely. That's when we understood we needed to look toward Europe 🌍.\n\nAnd by 2022, we'd spent a long time preparing to enter the European market, doing everything necessary. In the first year, we set up a legal entity in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and began a similar path—business trips, meetings, product showcases—trying to break into Europe.\n\nIn the Netherlands we had the same model, but we leveraged our home experience and Hatch's reputation. You need open entities in the Netherlands, for example, if you already had Dubai because cross-country invoicing is messy 📋. Big clients prefer local partners (taxes, VAT reclaim) 💰. Local presence is the key for enterprise 🔑.\n\nWe started participating in conferences like GITEX. That's where the idea opened up that it's not just the MENA region or Europe — we began attending Web Summit, and participated three times 🎪. It was more of a startup scene, but we still tried finding clients there.",

It's about more than just comfort - it's about taxes, legal stuff, and making sure everything follows the rules. Imagine trying to convince a big company to work with someone who lives far away and might disappear - much easier when you have a real office and legal presence in their country. It's like the difference between buying from a neighborhood store versus ordering from a mysterious website!"

      "body": "So we see it's necessary to establish entities in a country you want to work with big clients 🏢. It's logical to start research and try new markets. Here is some nice relevant experience to share.\n\nThe UAE has been steady since 2016 🇦🇪. Netherlands ramped up in 2020 🇳🇱. We pivoted fully to the UAE by mid-2022.\n\nOn the one hand, Europe was tied to our partnership with Hatch, a Dutch IT company 🤝. We became their official reseller at home, and then deepened collaboration to co-develop products for Europe. The Netherlands was the logical base. Plus, Europe's e-commerce maturity: higher purchasing power, average order value, GMV — made it attractive 💰. But it's also conservative and competitive. On the other hand we have almost no competitors in Dubai 🎯.\n\nPost-invasion: we considered the U.S. 🇺🇸, Portugal 🇵🇹, Asia, LatAm 🌎.\n\nWe split efforts — Mexico 🇲🇽, Indonesia 🇮🇩, UAE 🇦🇪.\n\nMexico (Spanish-speaking LATAM gateway) cost ~$130K, yielded one client 💸. Mexico was seen as a stepping stone to the U.S., but cultural friction (\"mañana\" attitude) hurt. My sister (Anna Shishkina) co-ran an accelerator (Hacker Sprint) in Chile/Mexico/Brazil and praised Mexico's business climate. I thought it'd be a U.S. proxy — I was wrong 😅.\n\nBrazil might be better — we're now integrating with <a href='https://www.magazineluiza.com.br'>Magazine Luiza</a> 🇧🇷.\n\nIndonesia: the Dubai client moved there, so we followed 👥. Indonesia (270M people, fast-growing e-commerce) has 6 clients (<a href='https://www.samsung.com'>Samsung</a>, <a href='https://www.panasonic.com'>Panasonic</a>), but small checks 📱. Indonesia: huge population, booming e-commerce, low competition. A client connection helped. We're now expanding from there to Singapore/Malaysia 🌏.",

He discovered that Europe has lots of money but also lots of competition (like a crowded marketplace), while Dubai has less competition but you have to work harder to find customers. Mexico seemed like it would be easy because of family connections, but culture is tricky and can surprise you. The key lesson: try several places at once, but don't expect them all to work the same way!"

Sometimes it costs a fortune, but for you and your future readers it's free ☺\n\nWe didn't set any budgets or deadlines, decisions were intuitive 🤔. We'd wait for a crisis or clear signal to stop. In the U.S., the team lead also felt the lack of results, and we refocused on the booming home market 🏠.\n\nThere was a mistake in the U.S. strategy that I should mention: lack of experience in new markets 🇺🇸. We thought a 1–2 person team could work, but enterprise sales require systemic effort 💼. Breaking into big players like <a href='https://www.samsung.com'>Samsung</a> or <a href='https://www.lg.com'>LG</a> is nearly impossible without something extraordinary 🚀. The U.S. is hyper-competitive (<a href='https://www.salesforce.com'>Salesforce</a>, <a href='https://www.sap.com'>SAP</a> dominate). Big brands are hard to crack in the U.S. And we can't target adjacent segments because our tools solve pain points for big brands managing multichannel inventory (Amazon, eBay, etc.) 📦. SMBs can hire two people to handle this — they don't need our solution.\n\nCosts of U.S. effort: around $50K–$100K — salaries, travel, exhibits 💰. We saw the U.S. as a promising point. The Netherlands was a stepping stone. In 2019, I even opened a U.S. entity (Delaware), did a roadshow, attended NRF in Chicago, and hired a small biz-dev team 🚂.

Think of it like trying to win a soccer game with only 2 players against a full team of 11 - it's almost impossible. Big companies in America have LOTS of people trying to sell to them, including huge companies like Salesforce that have thousands of salespeople. Sending just 1-2 people to compete is like bringing a water gun to a sword fight. Sometimes the lesson is worth $100K because it teaches you what NOT to do - and that wisdom can save you millions later!"

It's better to learn some cultural nuances before you face them in your business (or ruin your business because of them). Maybe we should create a book called \"Cultural nuances for business\"? I'm sure it will be quite thick 📖.\n\nThe decision to move to Indonesia came at that moment: September, mobilization, the guys are here in Dubai 🇦🇪. October, we're all sitting in a rented apartment, like, \"how do we even live, my guys?\" And I'm like, \"Okay, this feels surreal, let's do something\" 🏠. So we just decided, \"Let's try Indonesia\", without any grand reasoning. Just: (1) we potentially have a client there, (2) it's a big market 🇮🇩.\n\nFor Mexico, same logic — and we sent Gen to check it out 🇲🇽. The idea was: we're in Dubai, Mexico, Indonesia — let's see where traction happens, then double down 🎯. That was the plan. But once we landed, the first six months were wild. Both markets welcomed us warmly. We quickly got in front of the right people. They'd say, \"Cool product, very interesting\" 👍. We got carried away, thinking contracts were around the corner.\n\nTurns out, in all these countries, basic feedback like \"You're great guys\" means nothing 🤷‍♂️. We took it as validation, but it was just politeness. Mexicans, I think, literally can't say \"no\" ❌.\n\nLater I got that: \"no\" doesn't exist in Latin America. But here's the kicker: they don't say \"yes\" either 🤯. There's even a YouTube video on how to say \"yes\" properly here. If you say \"sim (yes)\", they instantly peg you as a foreigner. Their \"yes\" and \"no\" are coded differently — neither is direct.\n\nCosts. Mexico was the priciest in salaries 💰. English-speaking Mexicans = $4k/month. Indonesia: $1k. Dubai: $2.5k–$3k.",

When someone says 'cool product, very interesting,' Americans think that means 'I want to buy it!' But in other cultures, it might just mean 'I'm being polite and don't want to hurt your feelings.'

We tried doing it ourselves, but broken English/local distrust killed us. In Dubai, we hired Syrians, Iranians, Indians 🇦🇪.\n\nMexico fits Gen—he's into football ⚽, the culture. We even had a Mexican working for us in the CIS. So we decided that Gen is taking this market 🇲🇽. He went with a local Mexican too—they knew the drill. There were a dozen hires (even remote Paraguayans). Mexicans were the toughest. No feedback tolerance. Eventually, we pared back to Gen and José.\n\nIndonesia vibed with Tyoma - Bali, all that 🏝️. It keeps 3–4 locals + remote eastern europeans. Indonesians: chill but responsible 😌.\n\nThe rest (CTO, ops) stayed close to us for timezone alignment ⏰. All production and support are still there.\n\nHiring: LinkedIn (1k Dubai apps/day) 💼. Firing: by the book. Zero guilt — they never felt they underperformed.\n\nOutsourcing: to hire locals we used agencies, local only 🏢. Language is everything 🗣️.\n\nTried lead gen agencies ($5k/month for meetings) 💰.

We also had a \"Growth Director\" overseeing expansion — big mistake: too early to delegate 🚫. Year one, I was barely involved in biz-dev ops. Reports sounded rosy (\"Meetings! Connections!\"), but no revenue 💸.\n\nAfter 1.5 years, we pivoted hard: slashed teams, hyper-focused on deals 🎯. Reputation matters—B2B relies on trust, relationships 🤝. We didn't invest in community-building (forums, academies, awards) like we do now. At home, reputation grew organically; abroad, CIS founders faced extra hurdles. So, the biggest lesson: reputation first, sales second 🏆.\n\nTalking about priorities, I can put it like this:\nDubai #1 (I'm here daily) 🇦🇪.\nIndonesia #2 (timezone) 🇮🇩.\nHome (steady ops) 🏠.\nMexico is \"the neglected child\": I'd take late calls, but zero focus 😴.\n\nOur Biggest mistakes:\nSpray-and-pray taught us fast, but cost a lot 💰.\nShould've validated first, scaled later.
