      "description": "Successful tech expansion requires founder commitment - if you're not willing to spend significant time in a target market, don't enter it. Creating markets is fundamentally different from entering existing ones, requiring patience and educational approaches rather than competitive strategies. Local partnerships become critical in relationship-driven markets like India, where personal connections often outweigh product superiority. Cultural business practices matter immensely - from American 'small talk' rituals to Indian price sensitivity and decision timelines. Extended credibility-building periods are necessary, especially in B2B sales cycles that can span 1-2 years."

Now called Tion, it was our initial venture after completing our postgraduate studies when we realized that being scientists wasn't the only way to make an impact. We focused exclusively on the home market at first, though we always had global ambitions since clean air is a universal need, not a country-specific problem. üåç\n\nTion now has about 400 employees and operates independently in the air purification and disinfection niche. About 10 years later (around 2014), while Tion was already established, we became interested in whether we could monitor and measure ambient air parameters to manage air quality better. This led to creating an internal division, which later became an independent business called CityAir. üè≠\n\nCityAir develops and produces monitoring systems for air quality management at city and industrial enterprise levels. It's complex high-tech work involving sophisticated sensors, signal recovery algorithms, and atmospheric physics mathematics, all operating on a unified platform. üìä\n\nAfter successfully solving these technological entrepreneurial challenges at home, we felt ready to test ourselves globally. It wasn't about market immaturity or financial ambitions - it was about challenging ourselves. Could we replicate our success internationally? In 2021, we established a new company in the US üá∫üá∏, which became our headquarters for all international operations. üíº",

      "body": "You asked why we chose the US market over other potential options, and there were several key factors in our decision.\n\nWe were looking for a market that met multiple criteria. First, the US is incredibly diverse and essentially functions as more than just one market - it's a large territory where we could definitely apply our expertise. Second, we were drawn to the entrepreneurial culture and business environment. üíº\n\nWe had actually considered both the US and the Netherlands üá≥üá±. The choice came down to corporate culture and value systems. We feared other European countries might feel sluggish and slow, while the US seemed to have the entrepreneurial spirit we were looking for. ‚ö°\n\nHaving visited the US multiple times previously helped with this decision. Additionally, many of our team members are graduates of the Physics Department of Novosibirsk State University, and you can find NSU physics graduates at virtually every American university. This gave us a ready network of professional connections, which was particularly valuable since our work involves complex technological solutions. üéì\n\nWe had already collaborated with institutions like MIT on joint material science projects, so things were starting to progress naturally. When you have an existing network of contacts, a compatible corporate environment, and a cultural fit, it makes the decision much easier. ü§ù\n\nWhile the Netherlands was also considered for its entrepreneurial spirit, it's simply smaller with fewer connections. Once we confirmed there were no major obstacles to entering the US market, we prioritized it based on scale and systematic approach. The US represented a larger, more independent opportunity. üìà\n\nIt's worth noting that we don't really enter existing markets - we create markets. When you're doing something innovative, you need to form the market from scratch, which is difficult to analyze in advance. Our approach was intuitive but logical - we knew our air quality solutions could be in demand in the US, even if there wasn't an established market for them yet. üöÄ",

We entered with two vertical products: systems for monitoring and controlling atmospheric air (targeting cities and industrial enterprises) and systems for monitoring, analyzing, and managing air quality at large facilities (targeting building owners, operators, and large employers). üè¢\n\nOur first contacts came through individuals who had built Vernstad in Washington, DC. We launched pilots in several cities and real estate projects, though we didn't immediately work with industrial companies. As we gained traction, our presence in the US became more systematic and regular. üìç\n\nWe didn't create a formal business plan due to the high degree of uncertainty. Instead, we developed a set of critical objectives that needed to be accomplished or learned, drawing on our previous experience, including Tion's launch in China üá®üá≥. The approach was focused on clear goals rather than complicated plans. üéØ\n\nOur strategy differed from our China experience in significant ways. In China, my partner Anton Zhuchkov took the lead, and we followed his guidance since he was on the ground. The Chinese market presented communication challenges because few people spoke English and negotiations were difficult due to cultural differences. üó£Ô∏è\n\nFor the US, I understood that I needed to be personally involved in building everything. For a small company like ours, we realized it was impossible to succeed without the founder or co-founder spending significant time in the market, especially with a B2B business involving both hardware and software where you're selling not just products but expertise. üîß\n\nThis 'founder-led' approach became a key criterion in our market selection - I needed to be willing to spend substantial time in the country we chose. Even if another market might have been more attractive from a business perspective, if I wasn't prepared to commit significant time there, we wouldn't go. ‚è∞",

The first trips were exploratory - while we had done some desk research to understand the market structure, the most valuable insights came from direct engagement. üìù\n\nWe scheduled meetings with potential clients and presented our solutions to gauge interest. This practical market research involved meeting people, discussing our offerings, collecting feedback, and adapting our approach. When we received enough positive responses indicating people were ready to work with us, we decided to formalize our presence by establishing a company. ‚úÖ\n\nIt took about three years from our first exploratory trips in 2018 to establishing the legal entity in 2021. This extended timeline was partly due to dividing our focus - we still had projects at home requiring attention, which prolonged the process. If we had committed 100% to the US market from the beginning, our progress would have been much faster. üöÄ\n\nDuring those three years, we didn't have commercial sales - our product has a long sales cycle, sometimes up to two years. However, the feedback was consistently positive enough to justify continuing. Based on various metrics and our overall assessment, we concluded that with proper focus, we would definitely succeed. üìä\n\nThe commitment from potential clients was significant - when major corporations agree to pilot your technology with the intention to buy if the pilot is successful, that demonstrates serious interest. While these pilots weren't immediate sales, they represented clear steps toward commercial relationships. üè¢\n\nThe process was gradual. On our first business trip, we would meet someone who showed interest. We'd exchange information, return for follow-up meetings, and slowly move the relationship forward. We also participated in exhibitions and university events, organizing seminars that brought together local professors and researchers. üéì",

In our experience, we can find mutual connections with almost anyone, which made it easier to get started. These warm introductions were crucial in the beginning. ü§ù\n\nWe also experimented with cold outreach, hiring Anton Glotkov (who's now in London) and his team to help with this approach. While these cold calls didn't immediately convert to contracts, the positive responses - people's willingness to call, meet, talk, and move forward - gave us confidence. üìû\n\nThe choice to work with Anton wasn't particularly strategic - we knew each other from Academic Town and had crossed paths multiple times. When our warm introductions were working well, we recalled Anton's expertise in this area. While we did look at other options, our established relationship and mutual trust with Anton was valuable. We shared similar terminology and trusted each other, which meant we could focus our energy on the market rather than spending time synchronizing with a new contractor. üíº\n\nWe didn't consider hiring American contractors for this work. First, there's a misconception that native English speakers necessarily make better salespeople. Often, non-native speakers who are fluent can be more concise and clearer in their communication. Second, and more importantly, we were entering a nascent market without established experts. üå±\n\nSince city-wide air monitoring and control systems represent an emerging field, there weren't specialized American contractors with specific expertise in this area.

The East Coast had the highest concentration of potential customers and contacts, making it easier to start there. While we had promising leads on both coasts, we ultimately decided to focus on the East Coast based on the momentum we were building there. üóΩ\n\nOur team in the US was quite small - primarily myself, sometimes with one or two others. With limited resources, we chose to concentrate our efforts where we were seeing the most traction. The plan was to establish ourselves solidly in one region before expanding to others, which would be much easier once we had a stable foundation. üéØ\n\nRegarding deadlines, we didn't set a specific time frame after which we would abandon the US market if unsuccessful. We believed in our eventual success, but we did have criteria for decision-making. If progress remained stalled for an extended period and financing became unclear, we would need to reconsider. Our approach was to continue as long as we felt we were making sufficient progress and had the resources to support our activities. üìà\n\nHad we spent three years actively working in the US without achieving anything substantial, our perception of the prospects might have changed. However, our sense of opportunity in the US was constantly growing. We were close to securing substantial contracts: in our industry a single contract can be worth around a million dollars annually. With several such contracts, the business becomes self-sustaining, allowing for further hiring, operations, and development. üí∞\n\nThe main reason we only approached opening a legal entity in 2021, three years after our initial exploration, was that we had resources at home supporting us. We weren't launching a completely new product but rather adapting one we had been working on for 15-18 years. With 500 people behind us (though not all directly involved), we had strong support for our US efforts, including impressive websites and UX/UI that resonated with customers.

      "body": "You asked about cultural differences in business practices between the home and the US markets.\n\nOne significant advantage we discovered is that it's actually easier for small entrepreneurs in the US when dealing with corporations. Large corporations tend to look suspiciously at small contractors at home: a company with 50 people might be viewed as too small to be trusted. In the US, corporations routinely work with many more contractors than their counterparts. There's a much greater willingness to trust small companies with important components of their business. ü§ù\n\nI remember a meeting with a major oil and gas company at their headquarters. We arrived in casual attire with our presentation, and found eight executives who had printed our materials and made detailed notes throughout. We were impressed by how prepared they were and the quality of communication. People not only spent time with us but listened carefully - a definite advantage of the US business environment. üëî\n\nOn the challenging side, there's much greater accountability for your commitments in the US. If you promise something will be ready by a certain date, it absolutely needs to be delivered as promised. Delays or changes can significantly damage your reputation. ‚è∞\n\nWe also noticed that being a non-local company created some initial hesitation - there's an assumption that such companies might be less reliable, might miss deadlines, or forget commitments. We had to prove that we didn't operate that way. üåç\n\nAnother cultural difference that initially confused us was the practice of 'small talk' before meetings. Americans often spend time discussing weather or other casual topics before getting to business. Our instinct was to say 'let's get down to business,' but we learned that skipping this social ritual could be perceived as offensive. This pattern is well-described in cultural studies like 'Culture Map' - from our experience, those observations are accurate. ‚òÄÔ∏è\n\nFurthermore, we found that American business culture values preparation and professionalism highly, but also appreciates directness and efficiency once relationships are established. üìã",

We started as a CIS company exploring the market, and there were no issues with interacting and communicating with potential American clients without a US entity. We were transparent about our approach: we would first deliver value, and if necessary, establish a legal entity later. üè¢\n\nThis approach was completely acceptable to our American contacts. These were long-term contracts under discussion, so the understanding was that if we proceeded with significant business, we would set up the appropriate legal structure. The same applies with investors - at the pre-seed stage, you don't necessarily need a company already established. If there's mutual interest, you can create the entity when needed. üíº\n\nSetting up a company can be done quickly online, so there was no advantage to doing it prematurely. As for reputation concerns, we found that being upfront about our status and plans was sufficient. üíª\n\nWhen events in 2022 forced us to reconsider our global strategy, we already had an established US legal entity with two employees. Our pilots continued running, though we had to pause more ambitious expansion plans. Import restrictions and visa issues (I had been in the process of obtaining a visa but couldn't return, and have been under administrative review for 14 months) effectively put our US operations on hold at their current stage. ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nAt that point, we needed to establish clear legal boundaries, and we couldn't operate in the US as we had previously. This led us to explore other markets where we could maintain momentum. üåç\n\nThe lesson here is that transparency about your legal status and future plans is often more valuable than premature entity creation.

First and most obvious: air quality in India is notoriously poor, making it a perfect fit for our solutions. Combined with a growing economy and expanding middle class increasingly concerned about quality of life, the market opportunity was clear. Air and India are frequently mentioned in the same sentence, and our 18 years of experience in air quality management was directly applicable. üå´Ô∏è\n\nSecond, we found that India had fewer concerns about our origins than Western markets. In the current geopolitical climate, this removed a significant barrier to entry. üåç\n\nThe third and perhaps most decisive factor was finding the right partner. A woman from my town is married to an Indian man whose brother - a retired high-ranking military officer - became interested in becoming our partner. Without him, we likely wouldn't have proceeded despite the market's potential. He's now a businessman who serves as president of a well-known school community, bringing valuable connections and local expertise. ü§ù\n\nOur approach to India was more systematic than our US entry. We immediately established a joint venture with a local CEO (the former chief of Honeywell India) and started hiring people to conduct meetings with potential customers. We also engaged marketing and PR agencies to support our efforts. üìà\n\nWe changed our approach because we immediately had a partner with whom we could do more. In India, having local partners is critical - you simply cannot function effectively without them. Even visiting different areas of the country is challenging without local support. The fact that we could immediately establish this foundation allowed us to move more aggressively than we had in the US. üöÄ\n\nThe Indian market is highly fragmented, and business relationships are strongly influenced by personal connections. If your salesperson isn't just from India but specifically from the relevant state or region, they'll be much more effective. The system of insiders and outsiders is pronounced - people naturally prefer to work with those from their own circles, even if the offerings are inferior. üë•",

First, it's an extremely price-sensitive market. People tend to overestimate India's market size based on population, but in reality, the addressable market is much smaller due to this price sensitivity. If you don't understand how to work with pricing in this environment, you'll struggle significantly. üí∞\n\nSecond, everything in India moves exceptionally slowly. Any legal actions, agreements, or contract signings take much longer than what we're accustomed to elsewhere. This requires adjusting expectations and planning for extended timelines. ‚è∞\n\nThird, it's virtually impossible to operate without a local partner unless you're a major corporation like Microsoft. Finding the right partner is critical - they must be trustworthy, have a good reputation, and be well-connected. This may be the most significant challenge of all, as partners must be chosen based on trust, which is difficult to establish quickly without existing connections. ü§ù\n\nOne of our most significant mistakes was underestimating the differences in management approaches between our team and our Indian partners. Despite our partners being relatively westernized and speaking the same business language, we discovered we had very different views on organizational structure and management systems. üè¢\n\nThis apparent similarity led us to pay insufficient attention to aligning our management approaches. We thought we were thinking the same way, but our experiences and backgrounds created significant differences. We should have spent more time discussing not just what we wanted to achieve, but how we would work together to achieve it. This oversight cost us efficiency and time. üíº\n\nWe've now begun explicitly addressing these differences, suggesting various management frameworks and practices that account for both our approach and the Indian context. Companies familiar with international operations often bring their own managing directors who understand how to navigate these differences, placing them in key operational roles while having a local CEO who serves as the face of the company externally. üåç",

      "body": "You asked about how we adapted our products for the Indian market specifically.\n\nWe have multiple product lines, each requiring different adaptations. Even for Breezer, which is conceptually our simplest product (compact ventilation units with advanced air purification), we had to make significant changes. These units were originally designed as high-end solutions for environments with moderate pollution, but India's extreme pollution levels (often reaching 500 micrograms of particles per cubic meter) required substantial modifications. While we didn't manufacture these devices ourselves, we provided detailed requirements for their adaptation based on our expertise in measuring and understanding air quality. üìä\n\nFor our monitoring platforms (both outdoor and indoor air management), we essentially recreated them for the Indian market. While we had core components developed previously, the specific products relevant to India are being developed based on continuous market feedback, which informs both long-term technology development plans and shorter-term product upgrades. üîÑ\n\nThe adaptations fall into two main categories. First, price considerations dramatically influence technology choices. Just as books on Amazon's Kindle store might cost 5-10 times less in India than in the US, our solutions needed to reflect local economic realities without compromising effectiveness. üí∞\n\nSecond, the actual concentration of air pollutants in India is much higher both outdoors and indoors. This creates entirely different technical requirements for our systems. All other product refinements - such as specific widgets, QR codes, or communication protocols - are not India-specific and would emerge similarly in any market. üå´Ô∏è\n\nOur office in Gurugram serves as both a workspace and Experience Center where we demonstrate our technologies to clients. The air quality in our office is 50-100 times better than outside, providing a dramatic demonstration of our capabilities. This physical presence is crucial - clients need to see, touch, and experience our equipment. Having a professional office also builds credibility in the market. üè¢\n\nWe chose Delhi after visiting multiple cities including Bangalore and Mumbai. Delhi has the most acute air quality problems (winter there is an ecological disaster) combined with the highest concentration of potential clients. While Mumbai is also a major business center, Delhi offered the optimal combination of need and opportunity. üåç",

      "body": "You asked about the transaction cycle and processes in India.\n\nOne of the most significant factors affecting business development in India is the extended time frames for everything. The typical time between stages in the sales process or between client contacts is much longer than in other markets. Clients take considerably more time to evaluate and make decisions. ‚è∞\n\nBeyond this general slowness, there's another crucial factor: you need to establish your organization's longevity in the market. If you arrived a year or two ago and might leave in another year or two, potential clients will be hesitant to commit. During our first year, it was nearly impossible to close sales simply because we were new. Now in our second year moving toward our third, we have established a history that makes things easier. üìà\n\nThis credibility challenge means you need financial resources and determination to operate without orders for an extended period. You must be prepared to invest in building your presence and reputation before expecting significant commercial returns. üí∞\n\nThe trust-building process can't be rushed, and having a strong local partner is essential for navigating these dynamics. Our office, team size (about 30 people), and growing track record all contribute to building the credibility needed for long-term success in this challenging but potentially rewarding market. üè¢\n\nWhat we've learned is that patience isn't just a virtue in India - it's a business requirement. The companies that succeed here are those that can maintain operations and team morale during extended periods without significant revenue, knowing that once credibility is established, business relationships can become very strong and long-lasting. ü§ù",
