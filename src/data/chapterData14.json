      "description": "International expansion requires extreme preparation and realistic expectations. Success comes from small, focused teams (3-5 people) that prioritize the 20% of tasks delivering 80% of results. Dubai serves as an excellent franchise showcase due to its visa-free access, transport hub status, and presence of global competitors. The key to success is methodical audience building, continuous adaptation, and treating expansion as a long-term battle rather than a quick win. Even experienced businesses must relearn their skills in new markets, but with proper preparation and persistence, profitability is achievable within the first month."

And I'll build the business here within 2 months. That's not true. ‚ùå\n\nIt is painful, scary, and you need to think 300 times before doing it. Then calculate 200 times whether you have enough üí∞ money for it, and then think again. I've seen a lot of businesses that entered Dubai thinking it's easy and now they're leaving disappointed with big financial losses. üìâ\n\nEntering foreign markets is not a walk in the park üå≥, it's a battle ‚öîÔ∏è, a long one, and it's tough. You're entering a place where you don't know the rules, the culture, you practically know nothing. It's like you're rediscovering the üåç world. Even if you know how to build businesses in your home country, here you're literally relearning that skill. It's like learning to walk again after an injury. üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\nThat's probably the first super important point. ‚ö†Ô∏è\n\nEven though it's tough, it's still possible. ‚úÖ\n\nNext letter we're moving directly to us.",

The truth is it requires extreme preparation, significant financial resources, and the mindset that you're essentially starting over. Even successful domestic businesses must relearn their skills in new markets. It's not a 2-month project - it's a long-term battle that requires thinking 300 times and calculating finances 200 times before starting."

Plus, we were already entering Kazakhstan, which is the CIS, but we also saw a positive response there. üìà Instead of overthinking, we tried launching the concept in Dubai, in a joint location with [Dodo Pizza](https://dodobrands.io) and drinkit.

For America you need a visa, for some European countries you need a Schengen visa. Dubai is visa-free, and we understand that drinkit is a franchise, and it's mainly a business. üíº It's very important for us to show as many people as possible our locations.\n\nIt was clear that if we entered a country where all the major global players are present, and we learned to compete with them, we'd refine the drinkit concept to compete better in other countries. üèÜ It was more of a high-level strategic analysis. I don't remember comparing GDP, Taxes, or some other parameters.\n\nWe specifically chose not to set strict deadlines or success metrics for the Dubai launch, preferring to adapt as we learned. üìä\n\nThat's all for now,",

Maybe I'd say these aren't mistakes but lessons learned in Dubai. üìñ\n\nThere were definitely hiring lessons, a bad hire. Generally speaking, we hired a very lazy guy. üò¥\n\nWe were close to investing into manufacturing at an early stage. But these aren't mistakes of entering Dubai.\n\nWhen you run a business, you learn lessons along the way. You always find the right keys üîë to the audience and build the model correctly.\n\nWe immediately found our audience. But the lesson here is that you need to constantly, very methodically, win over the audience ‚Äî the market is very competitive. üèÅ For example, I see that revenues in Marina (our first location) are doubling compared to last year. üìà You build your client base through hard work, a great product, and excellent service. It's more about building relationships. ü§ù\n\nWe introduced one drink ü•§, then expanded, then introduced food üçï. Now we're looking for the right keys to the food. These are the lessons we're learning.\n\nThe same goes for economics. For drinkit, we see that we need to adjust the models to reach the target economics. If we're talking about breaking even, our first location in Marina broke even in the first month. üí∞\n\nThank you for your attention! üôè",
