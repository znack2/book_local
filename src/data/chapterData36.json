      "body": "You asked about what first triggered our international expansion efforts and what motivated me to look beyond the CIS market. 🤔\n\nThe catalyst came in 2023 when Checkme (my previous venture) reached breakeven. At that point, I decided to sell the company and create <a href='https://renova-insurtech.com'>Renova</a> 🚀, which was designed for international markets from the beginning.\n\nThe decision to go international rather than launching another venture in the CIS was driven by several considerations. I determined that the smartest move was to continue in insurtech, leveraging my existing expertise and knowledge. 🧠\n\nWhat many don't realize is that home insurtech and fintech sectors are actually quite mature and advanced compared to many markets globally — even some Western countries. This meant I could compete globally based on my specialized knowledge rather than starting from scratch in a new industry. It made sense to focus on what I knew best, where I had proven expertise that could translate internationally. 💪\n\nWe conducted our own research to identify promising regions, ultimately landing on Latin America (LATAM) 🌎 and the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 🕌 as our primary targets.",

Think of it like being really good at video games 🎮 - if you master a hard level, the easier levels become simple! Her home market was so advanced that other countries seemed easy by comparison. Instead of learning something completely new, she used her existing knowledge as a secret weapon to compete worldwide. 🗡️"

      "body": "You asked about which markets we considered initially and what parameters we evaluated during our selection process. 🤔\n\nAfter careful analysis, I settled on LATAM and selected MENA countries as our primary targets — specifically Mexico 🇲🇽, Colombia 🇨🇴, Chile 🇨🇱 and Dubai 🇦🇪. Our evaluation included several key parameters:\n\n• Number of insurance brokers in each region 👥\n• Presence of digital competitors 💻\n• Openness to innovation 🚀\n• My familiarity with the local language 🗣️\n\nLATAM presented particularly compelling opportunities. For example, insurance penetration in the region is only around 2.5% of the population (compared to 11% in Spain 🇪🇸). While initially this might seem discouraging, we noticed the market had grown to 3% in just two years — representing a 30% increase! 📈 This rapid growth signaled significant potential.\n\nTwo factors made LATAM especially attractive:\n\n• A clear merger wave starting in our industry 🌊\n• A broker-dominated sales model (unlike home, where insurers sell directly) 🏪\n\nIn Mexico alone, there are approximately 80,000 brokers selling essentially the same policies from the same insurers. This intense competition means brokers desperately need value propositions to differentiate themselves — creating perfect conditions for our SaaS solution. 💡\n\nWe also evaluated existing solutions (finding about 20 SaaS competitors, some with recent funding) and regulatory environments. We prioritized markets with low regulatory barriers (avoiding GDPR-like regulations or expensive licensing requirements). 📋\n\nMy language skills were another consideration. I already knew Spanish at what I'd call a \"Catalonian Spanish\" level — enough to communicate but also enough to occasionally annoy Mexicans with my accent! 😅 I had studied Spanish at university, which gave me a foundation, though I wouldn't have become truly fluent without practice. This language capability made LATAM particularly accessible.\n\nUsing similar criteria, we also identified opportunities in the Middle East, specifically Dubai. 🕌",

      "body": "You asked about our research methodology and how we gathered market data for our expansion decisions. 🤔\n\nOur approach was predominantly desk research due to budget constraints in the early stages. We relied on several sources:\n\n• Reports from major consulting firms 📋\n• Government data (for example, Mexico maintains a public registry of insurance brokers) 🏛️\n• Industry publications and market analyses 📰\n\nWe developed a structured evaluation process, first assessing feasibility on a 1-10 scale for each potential market, then estimating market size and potential revenue. For instance, in Mexico, we calculated that capturing just 5-8% of the market could translate to approximately $20M in ARR! 💰\n\nWe looked at markets worldwide but systematically ruled out over-regulated regions like the United States 🇺🇸, Europe 🇪🇺, and parts of Asia where entry barriers were prohibitively high. We also eliminated markets where policy values were too low to support our SaaS model — for example, in Indonesia 🇮🇩, policies typically cost around $200 per year versus $2,000 in Mexico, making our value proposition less compelling.\n\nAfter a year of operations, we found that our hard data research (broker counts, policy prices, market sizes) was largely accurate. ✅ However, cultural nuances proved more challenging to anticipate through desk research alone. For example, understanding that Mexicans culturally tend to avoid saying \"no\" directly — instead offering polite but noncommittal responses — was something we could only fully grasp through immersion. 🤝 These soft factors around sales tactics and business relationship development required local experience to navigate effectively.",

You can't Google \"how do Mexican business people really think?\" - you have to experience it yourself! 🌮"

      "body": "You asked about our team structure and go-to-market strategy for international markets. 🤔\n\n<a href='https://renova-insurtech.com'>Renova</a> was international by design from day one. 🌍 Our team structure assigned responsibilities based on functional roles rather than geography — CEO, local managers, CFO, legal, customer success, sales, and product all had defined international responsibilities.\n\nFor our initial expansion, we pursued parallel launches in Dubai 🇦🇪 and Mexico 🇲🇽, though we saw revenue materialize faster in Dubai (within 2 months ⚡ compared to 8 months in Mexico). While our product team remained centralized to maintain consistency, our go-to-market strategies differed significantly between regions. In Dubai, we employed a direct sales approach where I personally led product demonstrations. We engaged a high-ranking local lead manager from a top brokerage to help us build relationships and accelerate outreach. 🤝\n\nOur first international hire was on the product side. In the early stages, I handled most other functions (legal, finance) myself or with the assistance of GPT. 🤖 I've found that hiring non-product roles too early often creates inefficiencies before product-market fit is established.\n\nFor sales specifically, we initially avoided local hires in Mexico. My philosophy is that until product-market fit is proven, only founders can effectively drive early adoption. The passion, knowledge, and ability to make on-the-spot decisions are crucial in those early conversations. 💪 Later, as we began scaling, we added local sales representatives.\n\nTo motivate Mexican partners, we offered equity (typically 2% vesting over specific milestones) 📈 and emphasized our product differentiation compared to competitors. The key factor in securing these partnerships wasn't just the commercial terms — it was their genuine belief in the product and its potential. We used the same product deck for all partners initially, though we customized commercial terms (equity arrangements, etc.) during later discussions.\n\nOur go-to-market budget was approximately $600,000 💰, allocated to figure out what approaches would work best in our target markets. This included event participation and building partner networks.",

Looking back, there are several things I would improve about our market entry approach. 🤔\n\n• Faster local hiring: We should have established a Mexico-based agent sooner to navigate local complexities 🇲🇽\n• Leaner legal approach: We made an expensive mistake hiring in-house legal counsel based in Chicago, which wasn't necessary at our stage ⚖️💸\n• Simplified entity structure: We created unnecessary legal entities and registrations that could have been avoided or deferred 📋\n• More aggressive partner network development: We could have leveraged our early partners for referrals more effectively 🤝\n• Better peer collaboration: We should have learned more from companies like <a href='https://www.bitrix24.com/'>Bitrix24</a> and <a href='https://www.kommo.com/'>AmoCRM</a> about scaling internationally 🌐\n\nBeyond these strategic adjustments, we encountered significant cultural and operational learning curves:\n\n• Language immersion: I found myself eventually dreaming in Spanish and understanding Shakira's lyrics without translation 🎵 — this level of immersion expanded my thinking and cultural awareness in unexpected ways\n• Management adaptation: We had to adjust leadership styles significantly across markets. For example, deadline management in Mexico required a softer approach compared to other regions 🕰️\n• Talent assessment: We learned which local schools and backgrounds produced the best talent for different roles, which helped refine our hiring approach 🎓\n• Customer success transformation: Our reactive customer success model that worked elsewhere failed completely in Mexico — we had to shift to a more proactive, hands-on approach with significant hand holding 🤗\n\nOur real goal wasn't tied to specific revenue figures but rather validating product-market fit — securing even one paying client who genuinely valued our solution. 🎯",

After launch, we decided to outsource several functions including legal support 📝, public relations 📢, and customer service overflow 📞. This approach provided us with greater flexibility compared to full-time hires, particularly during our scaling phase.\n\nI've found that outsourcing offers better hourly accountability ⏰ and allows us to scale services up or down based on actual needs. This proved especially valuable as we navigated the different growth rates between our Dubai 🇦🇪 and Mexico 🇲🇽 operations.\n\nWhile our product team remained centralized to maintain consistency 🔧, we've been deliberate about which functions to build in-house versus outsource. Early on, I handled many functions myself or with GPT assistance 🤖 rather than building large teams prematurely. This lean approach allowed us to maintain flexibility while we validated our business model across different markets.\n\nFor anyone considering international expansion, I'd recommend carefully evaluating which functions truly need to be in-house versus those that can be effectively outsourced, especially during the early validation stages. Building too much infrastructure too soon can create financial strain before revenue streams are established. 💰",
