The story of how we first ventured beyond our home market is quite interesting 📊.\n\nWe started in 2019 with a clear vision of eventually going global 🌍, but at that time we simply didn't have the resources or opportunities to launch internationally. We began by fine-tuning our product 🛠️, building our team 👥, and developing a better understanding of our audience and value proposition 🎯.\n\nOur product provides end-to-end marketing analytics that combines data from advertising systems 📱, web analytics 💻, and CRM to build comprehensive dashboards and attribution models 📈. While we were focused on the home market 🏠, we remained open to international opportunities when they presented themselves.\n\nOur first international client came in 2021 - a Canadian company 🇨🇦 that often works with the CIS engineers. At that time, we didn't even have an English presentation ready and had to create one on the fly! 😅 While this opportunity came through a chain of recommendations rather than a strategic outreach effort, it provided valuable experience and validation ✅.\n\nInterestingly, this client initially approached us for marketing and growth strategy consulting 📋 (as we had started as an agency before developing our analytics product). However, what they really needed was a solution to determine whether their advertising would pay off if they increased their budget tenfold 💰. This required compiling data from numerous systems - precisely the problem our product was designed to solve 🎯. We were in the right place at the right time with the right solution for their critical strategic question ⚡.\n\nThis opportunity didn't arise randomly - it came after years of seizing small chances to work with English-speaking clients 🗣️, even when it wasn't immediately profitable. These experiences, representing just 2% of our total business 📊, gave us the confidence to pursue more international work when the time was right ⏰.",

Let me walk you through how our approach developed over time.\n\nThis approach works well for service businesses close to consulting 💼, which is why most agencies remain local - they build specific networks in specific locations with years of experience and recommendations 🤝. This model functions similarly across CIS, Australia 🇦🇺, the United States 🇺🇸, and elsewhere.\n\nA turning point came when I joined a small forum group of eight founders planning to take local businesses international 👥. For nine months, we met biweekly to discuss plans, progress, and challenges 📅. The most significant conclusion from this experience was that international expansion would not succeed until we either sold the CIS part of the business or completely stepped away from its operations 🚫.\n\nAs long as local business demanded our attention - dealing with sales issues 📞, metrics 📊, and team management 👨‍💼 - no international team would work effectively. This realization led us to make a serious commitment to internationalization 🌍, and we hired our first dedicated international team member 👔.\n\nBy late 2021, I had already built a successful, dividend-paying service business at home 💰 that had completed its transformation to self-governance. It required minimal time and effort from me ⏰, creating an opportunity to pursue my goal of building a product software venture business for the international market 🚀.\n\nWhile continuing to grow in the home market was certainly possible 📈, it wasn't as appealing. I had observed that despite several years of growth in all metrics 📊, the dollar-adjusted, inflation-adjusted income remained virtually unchanged 💵 due to periodic internal and external disruptions. Building something global from our local business seemed like the next logical and more interesting step in my development as an entrepreneur 🎯.",

      "body": "I've been reflecting on your thoughtful question about our decision to launch at home before targeting international markets 🤔. It's a point many entrepreneurs wrestle with, so let me share our reasoning.\n\nThe decision to start at home was primarily about resources 💰. When I became the leader, our agency was still undergoing transformation and wasn't particularly profitable 📉. We were facing a crisis with numerous simultaneous changes ⚠️. At that time, I had no experience raising external funding 💸, and it seemed illogical to make all our plans dependent on successfully doing something I'd never done before 🚫.\n\nI was also aware of a common trap many entrepreneurs fall into - starting something at the home market that works well 📈, then struggling to start from scratch elsewhere 🔄. However, I know myself well enough to recognize that I don't fall into such traps 💪. The things I want to accomplish eventually happen, even if they take time ⏰.\n\nOur approach was deliberately measured 📏. We began by selling our analytics service to five projects 5️⃣, and then allocated a dedicated team 👥. The agency could still handle simpler analytics work 📊, while we focused the new team on building a more technological product 🛠️. This approach operated at a small loss for the first few years 📉, but it wasn't as drastic as typical venture projects that swing between breaking even and burning significant capital each quarter 💸.\n\nThe alternative would have been to delay for 2-3 years and start completely fresh ⏰, but that didn't make sense. When you start moving in a direction, momentum builds 🚀 - you begin thinking about it, selling something related, conducting research 📚, forming a team 👥, and then realizing you need more developers and specialized skills 💻. Each step revealed new insights about architecture and customization needs that informed our development 💡.\n\nFor our international push 🌍, we initially hired a generalist marketer 📱 and soon after began testing external outreach agencies 📧. The marketer's role was focused on content and project management 📋 - building the website 💻, creating presentations and case studies 📊, generating messaging hypotheses 💭, and meticulously collecting analytics on our outreach efforts 📈. I needed this support because my calendar was already filled with internal team meetings 👥, networking 🤝, and other calls ☎️, leaving me with only about 10 hours per week for non-urgent tasks ⏰.",

      "body": "The strategies we used to test international channels is truly a fascinating topic! I'm glad you brought it up, as it was a critical phase in our global journey 🌍.\n\nWe began our serious international push on April 1, 2022 📅, after setting up the legal structure and banking relationships 🏦. My business partner and I agreed to bet on global expansion immediately rather than postponing it 🚀. Interestingly, at this time, all sales at home came to a halt as businesses were focused on more immediate concerns following global events 🌐.\n\nWe made a strategic decision not to hire anyone for our CIS business until we sold it 🚫, as growth there would distract us from our global ambitions. Instead, we used home operation for product development 🛠️, process refinement 🔧, and facilitating a smooth transition to global markets 🌍.\n\nInitially, we weren't certain which specific country to target 🤔. I spent considerable time networking with founders on similar internationalization journeys or those who had succeeded years earlier 👥. I needed to understand how marketing and management differed globally compared to home ones 📊. The surprising discovery was that there are very few differences - performance marketing functions essentially the same way worldwide 📈!\n\nWe ran parallel tracks: one for research and networking 🔍 (including travel to Armenia 🇦🇲, Turkey 🇹🇷, Latin America 🌎, and Dubai 🇦🇪 to meet people), and another for testing outreach channels 📧. Our outreach testing focused primarily on the US market 🇺🇸 from the beginning, as it seemed the most potentially interesting, though we hadn't fully committed to it yet.\n\nBy the end of 2022, we had decided to focus exclusively on the US 🇺🇸. In January 2023, I visited the US for the first time for several months ✈️, solidifying our commitment to this market.\n\nFor our outreach testing 📨, we chose cold email over LinkedIn initially, not because one is inherently better than the other, but because we found agencies with strong email expertise 💯. When you're testing multiple variables (country 🌍, vertical 🏢, client size 📏, problem specifics 🎯, messaging 💬, offer 💰, communication chain 🔗), it's best to limit the channels you're testing simultaneously. If email works ✅, LinkedIn will likely work too, and vice versa.\n\nThe task was to find a combination that would generate our first sales 💰 - a sign that we could refine this approach into a scalable channel with a viable economic model 📊. We focused only on potentially scalable experiments and spread our tests across diverse variables 🎯, like playing battleship - trying different points on the board rather than clustering around one area 🎮.",

      "body": "To address your question about talent acquisition for international expansion - this was indeed one of our most crucial challenges! 🎯\n\nOur approach to outreach agencies was based on recommendations and favorable terms 💰. The first agency we worked with specialized in cold calling ☎️ and only charged for scheduled meetings, making it a low-risk test given our limited resources. The second agency focused on email outreach 📧; while they operated on a subscription model, I was impressed with the founder's personal involvement, advice, and presentations during our discussions in the Earth Founders community 👥.\n\nWorking with these specialized agencies provided valuable insights even when they didn't deliver the expected results 📊. The cold calling agency generated some meetings but had a high no-show rate 🚫, and those who did attend often seemed confused about the purpose 🤔. The email outreach agency helped us test different segments by vertical and region 🌍, which improved our understanding of our most promising markets, even though we didn't secure any sales directly through them 📈.\n\nThis approach of starting with agencies rather than hiring in-house specialists is one I recommend 💡. When you lack expertise in a particular area, specialized agencies offer teams with processes 📋, standards ⭐, templates 📄, and experience 🏆. Together, you can determine what works for your specific business. If it succeeds ✅, you can continue the partnership; if not, you've gained valuable experience about the channel and understand what to look for if you decide to hire someone internally 👔.\n\nA significant breakthrough came when we found an excellent advisor from the American market 🇺🇸 who had previously been our partner. When he changed jobs and had some downtime ⏰, we established an advisory relationship 🤝. He provided crucial insights about the American market, sales processes, and costs - dispelling my illusion that clients could be acquired for $5,000-6,000 total cost per deal 💸. He showed me that American salespeople earn considerably more than I had estimated 💰, and that we needed to multiply our budget figures by at least three, with industry benchmarks suggesting a factor of five 5️⃣!\n\nThis advisor helped us create a model for hiring our first salesperson 👨‍💼 and set up email outreach on our domains 📧. From the very first campaign, we secured an interesting lead 🎯. The salesperson conducted an American-style sales pitch 🗣️, passed me the call 📞, and after five days of brief follow-up calls, the prospect became a customer 🎉. This experience provided tremendous confidence and clarity about how the US sales process works 💪.",

      "body": "The cultural nuances between CIS and American business practices you mentioned are spot-on! Let me share how we navigated these differences and transformed our approach 🔄.\n\nThe most significant discovery was the need for radical simplification 📉. Americans prefer straightforward explanations and visuals 👀. While we initially impressed our home customers with complex dashboards showing all our capabilities 📊, these same presentations scared American prospects 😰.\n\nWe redesigned our demo to start with simple dashboards featuring graphs and six key figures color-coded green and red 🟢🔴, relegating the more detailed, complex reports to separate sheets that could be explored later if desired 📋. We also found technological solutions to eliminate almost all integration tasks that previously required client engineering resources 🛠️.\n\nThis was crucial because American companies often have six-month engineering backlogs ⏰, and any product requiring significant technical integration would be immediately rejected 🚫. When prospects asked about implementation, we simplified to requiring just one line of code added to their website 💻.\n\nWith the help of AI 🤖, we created an interactive model demonstrating our value in 60 seconds ⏱️. The model shows three advertising campaigns with their lead generation costs 💰, then reveals how qualified leads change the cost equation 📊, and finally demonstrates how tracking paying customers and their lifetime value completely transforms budget allocation decisions 🎯. This simple, interactive approach makes our value proposition immediately clear ✨.\n\nWe also discovered that the average level of technical sophistication among marketers varies significantly between regions 🌍. While Moscow has many technically proficient marketers from top universities like Bauman and Phystech 🎓, the average American marketer outside major tech companies has less mathematical background and fewer engineering skills 📐. They excel at storytelling 📚 and applying standard playbooks 📖 but often lack the systematic approach found in more technical environments.\n\nThis isn't surprising given America's population of 340 million spread across relatively evenly developed regions 🗺️. The truly technical marketers in the US typically earn $500,000+ annually working in corporations and top startups 💸 - not our target market.\n\nAnother key learning was the importance of hyper-segmentation 🎯 - a distinctly American characteristic that puzzles professionals from other countries. In the US, you find highly specialized solutions for incredibly narrow segments - CRMs specifically for dental clinics 🦷, for example. While in CIS, we could offer end-to-end analytics services to a broad customer base, in America this approach doesn't work 🚫. The market is so large that even hyper-specific segments contain thousands of potential customers with appropriate budgets 💰.\n\nOur most successful approach has been focusing on \"ad-driven lead generating businesses\" 📱 like medical clinics 🏥, property developers 🏗️, automotive dealers 🚗, and certain service providers. These businesses understand the problem of tracking not just ad-generated leads but also real customers and their lifetime value 📈.",

We were encouraged by receiving leads and even making a few sales in this segment 📈, but we failed to recognize that established competitors like Triple Whale 🐋 and Northbeam had already captured the market.\n\nThese competitors had several advantages: they integrated directly with Shopify 🛍️ (used by 80% of online stores), offered more affordable pricing 💰 (3-4 times cheaper than our solution), and had spent years building brand recognition by sponsoring conferences 🎤 and accumulating case studies 📊. Despite our greater customization capabilities 🛠️, the value proposition wasn't compelling enough to overcome these barriers.\n\nWe lost considerable time focusing on this segment because the initial positive signals (leads, interest, and some sales) 📊 masked the ultimately low conversion rate to closed deals 📉. However, this experience helped us identify our true target market - what we call \"ad-driven lead generating businesses\" 🎯 like clinics 🏥, developers 🏗️, automotive dealers 🚗, and service businesses.\n\nThese companies understand the need to track not just lead acquisition costs 💸 but also conversion to actual customers and lifetime value 📈. Most importantly, when we asked about existing solutions to this problem ❓, virtually no one could name any serious competitors. The few services operating in this segment were small 📉, not growing rapidly, and posed no significant competitive threat 🚫.\n\nAfter restructuring our marketing for this segment in early 2024 📅, we began securing deals consistently - about three new clients monthly 📊. This steady growth attracted investor interest 💰, and we recently completed our seed funding round 🎉.\n\nIf I could do things differently 🔄, I would have attracted more investment earlier and assembled a stronger team from the start 👥. With limited resources, I tried to handle too much myself with minimal support 😅, but having several senior people from the beginning accelerates testing and learning exponentially 📈. I would also have immediately focused on making everything as simple and straightforward as possible for the American market 🇺🇸, where clarity and directness are highly valued 💡.\n\nMy inbox changed dramatically after moving to the US market 📧 - suddenly filled with interesting, well-crafted offers and advertisements 📱. Visit a product website once, and you'll see polished messaging from all its competitors across multiple channels in the following days 📺. While this intensifies the challenge of breaking into the market (requiring you to be notably better than competitors) 🏆, it also creates opportunities to excel in carefully chosen niches 🎯.\n\nOur next major milestone will be optimizing our cost structure to offer the full integration cycle for free 🆓, allowing clients to experience the value before making a final decision 💭.
