The most surprising insight: government export programs can be game-changers for SMEs, providing not just funding but structured frameworks that force strategic thinking and execution discipline."

You asked about our initial decision to explore markets outside the home market, and it's an interesting story. 📈\n\nThe truth is, while we started looking at international markets earlier, the military actions and changing situation in CIS really pushed us in that direction. At home, we're seeing massive market consolidation and monopolization across sectors. This is particularly evident in the energy sector where we operate - smaller players are being squeezed out through new legislation with minimum requirements. I realized this would eventually lead to Rosseti's growth, leaving us with no market at home at all. 🏭\n\nWhy not Europe or North America? 🤔 We're significantly behind in those markets. The technologies we offer are nothing new there, and considering the current geopolitical situation and my roots, I believe that path is closed to us. Deal cycles are already long in those regions, and I didn't want to invest months in negotiations only to have everything fall through because someone says, \"we can't work with you because of your language.\" 💬",

By the time we looked at the market, most companies had already invested in similar systems, and we had nothing new to offer them.

While I could read Portuguese, I couldn't effectively communicate with people there. I could have solved this by hiring local staff, but I didn't have the budget considering how long deal cycles might be. Rather than establishing a local branch that could be financially risky, I focused on finding partners. 🇧🇷\n\nI met with many potential partners in Brazil, and while they communicated normally and shared insights about their market, nothing materialized when I asked them to collaborate. They would say, \"Yes, we'll look into it and think about it,\" but then nothing happened. I may still try Brazil again after creating a Portuguese page and launching an advertising campaign. 💭\n\nWhy Colombia specifically? I considered several factors: 📊\n\nSome countries like Bolivia have only one energy company for the entire country 🏢\nArgentina's economy moves from one crisis to another, making business unpredictable 📉\nMexico would have been suitable but requires visas, which deterred me ✈️\nColombia is visa-free, has a rapidly growing economy, and is the third-largest market after Brazil and Mexico 📈\n\nMost importantly, Colombia has over 50 energy companies (one for each region), giving us multiple potential clients rather than just one nationwide monopoly. This creates more opportunities for communication, finding the right fit, and eventually generating referrals and word of mouth. 🤝\n\nCurrently, we're facing challenges with recommendations and references. In Colombia, they heavily rely on \"Sitos\" (reference letters). We've been providing recommendations from CIS companies, but I'm unsure if those will be effective. To get local recommendations, we need to implement our solution somewhere first, which could then create a snowball effect of referrals. ⭐",

I started by examining: 📈\n\nCompanies operating in our sector - identifying how many potential clients existed 🏢\nLaws and regulations governing our industry - it's always easier when there are regulatory requirements we can reference or economic incentives (like cheaper electricity rates through such systems or penalties for reactive power). ⚡\n\nAfter this basic research, I looked for integrator companies that deal with automation systems and work with energy companies. I approached them primarily to learn about the market - understanding what meters they use, what technologies are prevalent, and what pilot projects might be underway. For example, one mentioned they had a pilot with 200 Chinese meters using a specific technology. 🔌\n\nMost of my initial research was simply through Google searches. I didn't hire anyone to conduct formal market research or commission reports. I did read some articles on industry developments, but these were very general - mostly introducing the concept of these systems rather than providing specific data on implementations or results. They typically just mentioned that such systems were beginning to emerge in Colombia and that some foundational laws had been passed. 🔍\n\nAs for direct market experience, I first visited as a tourist, examining meters in houses and observing the infrastructure. Before that visit, I had connected with some industry experts on LinkedIn, though these conversations weren't particularly productive. What I observed convinced me that the Colombian market was similar to our 10 years ago - still developing and with significant growth potential. 👀\n\nWhile being a pioneer has challenges (potential customers don't yet understand what we're offering), I believe the timing is actually good - energy companies are aware of these technologies, some have pilot projects, and many want to explore implementation. It feels like the perfect moment to enter the market. ⏰",

Using LinkedIn, I searched for such companies and reached out to people working there, though many of these initial conversations didn't progress very far. 💼\n\nLinkedIn was my primary channel for making contacts. I didn't participate in webinars or conferences at that early stage - just direct outreach through LinkedIn messages. 📱\n\nMy workflow was essentially: 📝\n\nSelect a target market (Latin America) 🎯\nGather information through Google research 🔍\nFind relevant professionals on LinkedIn 👥\nMessage them to learn about the market 💬\nPlan a visit to see the market firsthand ✈️\n\nWhen I first contacted people, I had very limited materials. My initial outreach included a basic PowerPoint presentation - literally just our presentation with Spanish comments added on top. It was quite poor and purely introductory. We didn't have a proper Spanish website at this stage. 📊\n\nAfter visiting Colombia as a tourist and confirming the market potential, I decided to create a proper website. For this, we utilized a program through our local export center where they covered 80% of the cost and we paid 20%. The initial website was built on WordPress, but we faced limitations because our software itself hadn't been translated at that time. 💻\n\nDuring my first meetings with integrators two years ago, when they asked for demonstrations, I had nothing substantial to show them. I had to rely on Google Translate to showcase our interfaces on the fly, which was far from ideal. It wasn't until last summer that we began properly translating our program, completing it by fall. Only then did I return to Colombia with a properly translated version. 🌟",

Initially, I was skeptical - I had a preconceived notion that anything with the Skolkovo label might not be worthwhile. But I reluctantly signed up, partly because of the co-financing program (similar to the 80/20 website development program I mentioned earlier). 🤔\n\nThe experience completely changed my perspective. The program was excellent, with remarkably strong experts and valuable content. They provided insights about the international market in general and specific approaches for different regions. They covered working with Arab markets (which I immediately dismissed) and extensively discussed Asian markets, though unfortunately, they barely mentioned Latin America. 🌟\n\nThe program helped me understand how international markets function differently from CIS. Experienced entrepreneurs like Alexei Baranov shared their personal journeys, which was incredibly valuable. I learned practical skills like optimizing my LinkedIn profile and began posting regularly. We discussed scientifically-backed approaches to entering established international systems. 💼\n\nWhile I can't say I'm following everything I learned there perfectly, much of it has stuck with me. The experience was so positive that I now recommend similar programs to others in my city. If someone asks, I enthusiastically tell them, \"Yes, go for it! You won't regret it - it's an excellent program.\" 👍\n\nMy participation in structured programs has consistently driven our company's growth. When we operate independently, we tend to stagnate, but joining programs like the IIDF accelerator or this export accelerator creates immediate momentum. We've always sought out such opportunities. 📈\n\nThe key benefit of these programs is having dedicated time to work purposefully on specific business development aspects with expert guidance. More importantly, it was through this program that I made the decision to definitely visit Brazil, purchasing tickets before the program even ended. All the successful entrepreneurs who shared their experiences emphasized that you can't expect results while sitting at home - you need to physically go to your target markets and meet people directly. ✈️",

This is actually a significant obstacle for us internationally because our software doesn't function without compatible hardware. In CIS, this isn't an issue since suppliers know us well - they even pay us to integrate their meters into our system. But in new markets where we're unknown, we need to purchase local hardware and allocate resources to integrate it with our system. 🔌\n\nI tried contacting hardware manufacturers in Brazil to establish partnerships. Some never responded, while others said, \"We have our own software, we're not interested.\" This left me without hardware partners to recommend alongside our software, making our offer less compelling. 🇧🇷\n\nThe situation improved in Colombia. I identified which meter manufacturers were recognized there (American, European, and Chinese companies) and reached out to them about integration opportunities. Out of all the companies I contacted, only two responded, and with one of them, the relationship developed more productively. They fulfilled our order, and we added them to our partner list. Now we can recommend each other - I consistently recommend them, and they have a representative in Colombia who confirms our partnership if asked. 🇨🇴\n\nThis makes approaching potential clients much easier because we can offer a complete solution. There's a great supplier of metering devices that have been tested for years, the meters work excellently, buy from them, and we'll handle the rest. It sounds much more convincing than asking clients to source their own hardware. 💪\n\nBeyond the hardware partnership challenge, Brazil presented two additional obstacles: 🚧\n\nA strong local programming community with approximately 20 competing solutions similar to ours. 💻\nThe language barrier - while I initially met many Spanish-speaking people at the airport and during my first days (giving me false confidence), when I began meeting with integrators and potential partners, virtually none spoke Spanish. 🗣️\n\nThese factors combined led me to view Brazil as less promising than Colombia, which had fewer barriers to entry. ✅",

        "description": "Pavel learned that international clients want turnkey solutions, not just software. His Brazil struggles versus Colombia success shows how hardware partnerships can make or break market entry. The lesson: in new markets, you're not just selling your product - you're selling a complete ecosystem. Sometimes market selection should prioritize partnership opportunities over market size."

      "body": "You asked about our approach to advertising campaigns in Colombia and how we selected platforms and strategies. 🎯\n\nFor our initial advertising efforts, I built and tested various hypotheses about which topics might be interesting in the Colombian market. I quickly created landing pages for different concepts and launched Google ads to see which generated responses. Unfortunately, the results were generally disappointing across most topics, with the exception of our affiliate program. 📊\n\nI focused primarily on Google for our advertising, though I was aware that LinkedIn and Facebook were also important channels in these markets. This decision was largely practical - when I researched hiring local contractors to manage advertising, costs were quite high in both Brazil and Colombia. Instead, I leveraged our existing relationship with our CIS agency that handles our domestic advertising. 💰\n\nThis approach had several advantages: ✅\n\nCost efficiency - it was significantly cheaper than hiring local agencies 💵\nEase of communication - without language barriers, we could brainstorm and analyze results more effectively 💬\nTransferable expertise - Google's advertising policies are largely consistent globally, so their experience was applicable 🌐\n\nThe main adaptation needed was translation, which I handled myself. While this approach might not be ideal, it produced acceptable results - we generated website visits and gained insights about what needed improvement. 📈\n\nFor example, our CIS agency provided insights that local agencies might have struggled to communicate clearly due to language barriers. They explained technical aspects like budget management and campaign optimization in terms I could easily understand. 🔍\n\nIn retrospect, this hybrid approach of using our trusted partners while incorporating local market knowledge worked reasonably well for our initial market entry phase. 🎪",

        "description": "Pavel's approach of using his trusted CIS agency for international campaigns shows how SMEs can maintain quality while controlling costs. The key insight: global platforms like Google allow you to leverage existing relationships rather than starting fresh in each market. Sometimes familiar partnerships with local translation beat expensive local agencies, especially in early market testing phases."
