      "description": "This case study reveals the challenges of international market entry in the telematics industry. Key lessons include: 1) The critical importance of quality market research - outdated data from 2009 significantly delayed the project. 2) Budget flexibility is essential when entering unknown markets - initial costs are unpredictable until on-ground research is conducted. 3) Local presence is crucial for understanding market dynamics - remote planning has limitations. 4) Clear decision-making structures prevent delays, though this project benefited from streamlined leadership. 5) Branding and legal setup must happen simultaneously to avoid bottlenecks. The Brazil telematics market shows strong growth potential with 15% CAGR, making it an attractive target despite entry challenges."

Let me walk you through what actually happened from the inside.\n\nInitially, there was immediately a clear understanding of what we wanted overall. We knew we wanted to sell telematics, most likely with a focus specifically on security systems 🔒. Since we already had some experience in Brazil 🇧🇷 and some of our colleagues had traveled there, we had certain insights. By the time I arrived, there were already more than a thousand cars 🚗 equipped with our system, so we understood the landscape to some degree.\n\nOne of the first tasks was to conduct market research 📊. This wasn't something that emerged later - it was practically there from the very beginning. By the end of July, work had been going on for quite a while.\n\nThe situation with opening the bank account 🏦 was indeed one of our initial challenges. Your team helped us find lawyers ⚖️, and they found pretty good ones in the end. The account opening process was quite problematic - it wasn't simple because the legal entity was old and neglected, with no reports or tax declarations. But they managed to get it done.\n\nI created a Gantt chart 📅 for the project practically from the very beginning, outlining what we needed to accomplish and the timeline. We immediately knew we would have to start sales, and for this we first needed to do research to determine our target market, make a website 💻, and register a trademark - all of this was mapped out. Market Research was indicated there from the start.",

Our initial partners were busy with other projects and didn't have the resources to invest into our new venture, so we decided to open our own operations and develop there ourselves. The goal was to make a full-fledged enterprise there. I was told: \"Alexey, here are consultants for you, figure it out, and let's start working with them.\" 💼\n\nOne of the first tasks was to build a comprehensive plan and schedule 📋. Most importantly, we needed to figure out the market information because I didn't know Portuguese well enough initially. While I can read everything now and understand it all, I hadn't managed to learn to speak it properly at that time.\n\nThe project plan included looking for local people 👥 and engaging in various promotional activities. Everything was written out in principle. The only thing that changed later was essentially the timelines, and only at the very end did the project stop for reasons unrelated to the consulting work.\n\nThere was a deadline initially - we wanted to time this to an event in September 2023 📅, some kind of automotive exhibition where they display cars 🚗, similar to what used to happen at home. We didn't make that deadline for various reasons, but later we understood we needed more time anyway. When this moved to 2024, we had some periods where we stopped for almost a whole month ⏱️, particularly twice in the summer.",

I developed something like a strategy for myself - several dozen slides outlining our approach, hardware specifications, and various operational aspects.\n\nThe initial budget was essentially just working with your team, plus money 💵 for various websites 💻 and legal expenses ⚖️. The understanding was that when it became clear what kind of business plan we needed, then we would draw up a proper budget.\n\nAt some point this became clearer, but honestly, it only became fully clear when I arrived in Brazil ✈️. From Moscow, it's quite difficult to imagine the specifics. When I was actually in Brazil, I sat down and created a clearer Excel spreadsheet 📊 with a proper business plan - outlining how much we needed to sell, what the break-even point would be, and what Brazilians were generally interested in. I had preliminary versions before this, of course, but the real clarity came from being on the ground 🌍.",

      "body": "You were asking about what I most hoped to get from the research.\n\nI expected to receive marketing research in the most traditional, comprehensive form 📋. Something showing the telematics market and security systems landscape - who the main players were, with the usual diagrams and tables 📊. Information about how many cars 🚗 are sold, how many are insured, whether insurers attach their devices mandatorily or not. Initially, we didn't even know who our customer would be.\n\nThere are different types in the automotive sector: car makers 🏭, dealers 🏪, leasing companies. For leasing, if someone takes a car and stops paying, the lessor can press a button 🔘 so the car doesn't drive anymore, see its location on a map 🗺️, and retrieve it. Security systems vary too - fleet management, freight transport monitoring 🚛. We were looking at where we should focus our efforts generally.\n\nAfter some time, we decided that fleets would probably be more interesting to us initially, possibly freight transport. But we needed that foundational market intelligence to make informed decisions.\n\nThe research challenge was significant. We had no understanding of how much competitors' solutions cost 💰, no idea about subscription pricing models, or what services they offered. At home, for example, simple systems let you view your car from your phone 📱 or open doors remotely. More complex ones let you control the engine and start it in cold weather ❄️. Security systems range from basic notifications to full rapid response services with special groups checking on incidents 🚨.\n\nWe expected there would be similarities across countries, but we had no concrete understanding even by the beginning of 2024. The information we did get was often based on incomplete assumptions or data from just one company, making it unclear if it was representative of the broader market.",

Another cofounder does like branding discussions and participated in those decisions, but branding is essentially packaging and doesn't significantly affect project timelines or core operations.\n\nThere was no discord in our company - no situation where people were pulling in different directions 🤝. Everyone initially understood how this reflected in our plan: we wanted to have our own enterprise with everything ready - legally ⚖️, financially 💰, with a clear business plan 📋.

If we were going to approach new clients, we needed to have proper business cards 💳 and a website 💻 immediately so we could discuss our services professionally.\n\nThis became an immediate priority. We did delay the branding work somewhat because we initially planned to run a proper tender process, but it was decided internally to work with our existing partners instead.\n\nThe delay was also partly because it's difficult to create an effective website when you don't fully understand your target customers yet 🎯. And we couldn't fully understand our target customers partly because the marketing research had outdated data - like that 13-year-old insurance information 📊.\n\nI remember the table you compiled with about 10 Brazilian branding agencies 🏢. After evaluating the options, our company leadership decided to use our existing IT partners instead. The decision was practical: \"Alexey, why are you looking elsewhere when we have excellent companies that have already created everything for us and our partners? They're right here, we have contracts with them, and we communicate daily because we constantly launch new projects.\" The fact that they didn't speak Portuguese wasn't considered a problem since they work internationally anyway 🌍.\n\nHonestly, they came up with a great name - orbita ⭐ - which I really like.

I wrote down my ideas and sent a presentation - about five slides 📊 - emphasizing that we wanted to convey security focus 🔒 and that we had advanced technologies.\n\nRegarding timelines, there was definitely a clear understanding that branding needed to be completed by a specific date ⏰. We had that original schedule where everything was mapped out. Even though deadlines slipped, we immediately understood this needed to be done right away. You can see in the timeline that it starts immediately after the legal work ⚖️ and market research 📊 phases.\n\nSince the other components had deadlines, branding had to align with those as well.
