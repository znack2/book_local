      "body": "You asked about how and why we initially entered the international market rather than continuing to focus on the home market. Let me share our somewhat unique journey.\n\nSince 2012, I have been working as a consultant in the CIS, specializing in intellectual property management, registration of trademarks, and patent services. My clients were exclusively companies who needed IP services within the country. As these companies began expanding globally üåç, we started working with international partners to manage their intellectual property tasks abroad.\n\nDespite the success of this intellectual property consulting business, I always found it somewhat unsatisfying because it wasn't scalable üìà. This led me to conceptualize a platform that would optimize intellectual property management across different countries. The insight was simple: almost every ambitious startup envisions becoming a large international company operating across multiple markets. Managing IP across dozens of countries is both complicated and expensive üí∞, requiring local patent attorneys in each jurisdiction.\n\nOur platform concept addressed this challenge by connecting clients with local patent attorneys around the world üó∫Ô∏è through a single interface, making the process more efficient and cost-effective. Due to the nature of this service, we never had a specific geographic focus for our customer base. From the beginning, we designed our platform to serve clients from any country who needed IP services in any other country.\n\nThis global approach is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The disadvantage is that we don't immerse ourselves deeply in any single market's specifics or mentality. The advantage is our ability to serve a truly global client base - we currently have paying clients in more than 50 countries üåé despite being relatively small in terms of revenue.\n\nTo support this global approach, we use a combination of Google Ads, SEO optimization, content marketing, and translations into various local languages üó£Ô∏è. We typically create content in one language first, then translate it into different languages to reach a broader audience.",

        "description": "Instead of starting locally and expanding later, this company built a global platform from day one. This approach worked because IP management is naturally cross-border - companies need help in many countries, not just their home market. Think of it like building a bridge that connects every country's lawyers with every country's businesses, making complicated legal work simple and accessible."

      "body": "You asked about our early platform development and how we navigated the challenges of the changing geopolitical landscape.\n\nWe began developing our platform in 2021 üöÄ, initially focusing on building our provider network - patent attorneys and law firms from around the world. Our original strategy assumed we would first onboard our existing clients to generate initial cash flow üíµ, then gradually expand globally. However, the geopolitical situation in 2022 (the war in Ukraine and subsequent sanctions) completely disrupted this plan.\n\nWe quickly realized that onboarding local clients would actually hinder our international growth by making it difficult to attract investment üìä. Additionally, new sanctions meant that many international patent attorneys were unwilling to provide services to clients due to reputational risks. Even those willing to work with those clients faced practical challenges as international payment systems became unavailable üí≥.\n\nThis forced us to rapidly pivot our strategy. We had already registered a company in the US in 2021, but by 2022, many services had blocked it, rendering it ineffective. We abandoned that entity, established a new company in Armenia üá¶üá≤, transferred our development team there, and restructured our connections with our country to comply with the new reality.\n\nFor our provider network, we took a methodical approach to building global coverage. We identified accredited providers in each country (typically available through official agency websites or professional directories), then implemented aggressive email outreach and LinkedIn campaigns üìß. We hired a team of four people who managed automated mailings and personally followed up with everyone who responded. Our pitch was straightforward: providers could register on our platform for free üÜì, create a profile, and eventually receive deals with just a commission fee on successful transactions.\n\nThe conversion rates varied across different regions, with some cultural and language barriers emerging, but these didn't prevent us from achieving our goal of establishing a baseline of qualified providers in each target country. By the end of this initial phase, we had coverage in at least 100 countries üåç, starting with the major IP jurisdictions (US, Europe, Asia) and gradually expanding to more specialized markets.",

      "body": "You asked about our experience transitioning from building our provider network to acquiring clients, particularly the differences in approach and results.\n\nThere was indeed a dramatic difference between provider outreach and client acquisition. With providers, we were essentially offering them a free way to make more money üí∞ - a relatively easy sell with high conversion rates. With clients, we were asking them to spend money with an unknown platform lacking established trust - a much harder proposition resulting in significantly lower conversion rates üìâ.\n\nWe tested various approaches including email campaigns and LinkedIn outreach. We saw some replies, calls, and demos, but our conversion to actual deals was extremely low - perhaps one or two transactions in six months ‚è∞. The clients who did convert during this period were predominantly expats. The trust factor played a major role here; someone who shared a language and cultural background with us was much more likely to become a client than someone with no prior connection ü§ù.\n\nThis led us to an important insight that might be valuable for your book: focusing on the CIS community abroad can be a highly effective strategy when entering international markets with a young product üå±. These clients understand you better, trust forms more quickly, and they often have connections to the broader business community in their adopted countries. Even today, this segment remains a significant piece of our business.\n\nThe Americans we approached would often express enthusiasm during demos, claiming they were ready to buy immediately üéØ, but then would stop responding altogether. This behavioral pattern was quite frustrating and required us to adjust our expectations and follow-up strategies.\n\nOur early client acquisition difficulties were compounded by product usability issues. Even when we managed to drive traffic through advertising, visitors struggled to understand what actions to take on our platform ü§î. The complex nature of IP services meant that users would get lost, not knowing how to initiate a patent or trademark registration process. While our system worked well if someone guided users through it manually, self-service conversion was nearly non-existent.",

      "body": "You asked about how we evolved our strategy after the initial challenges and what led to our breakthrough moment.\n\nA significant turning point came in 2023 when we integrated AI into our platform ü§ñ. While living in California and speaking with various industry contacts, I discovered the potential of implementing an AI assistant to guide users through our complex service offerings.\n\nThe impact was transformative ‚ö°. For the first time, users who weren't personally guided by our team could successfully navigate the platform, discuss their needs with the AI assistant, create appropriate tasks, and receive price quotes from providers, and complete payments üí≥ - all within a single session. This dramatically improved our conversion rates from organic traffic.\n\nThis breakthrough shifted our strategic focus toward digital marketing üì±. With a product that could now convert visitors autonomously, we began investing more heavily in capturing online search traffic. Our approach focused on two primary channels:\n\nGoogle Ads - Targeting specific search terms related to IP services üéØ\nOrganic SEO - Building a massive content infrastructure for long-term growth üìà\n\nWe chose these channels specifically because they allow us to target users with clear intent. When someone searches for 'trademark registration in the USA' üîç, we know exactly what they need. This is much more effective than demographic targeting on platforms like Meta, where we can't be certain of user intent.\n\nFor our SEO strategy, we implemented an ambitious content approach. We created a separate optimized landing page for each service in each country - with approximately 15 landing pages per country üìÑ. We applied this structure across 50 countries and translated everything into 10 languages üó£Ô∏è. This resulted in roughly 7,500 landing pages, plus another 500 blog articles also translated into multiple languages. While this seems overwhelming, we managed to create this entire infrastructure for just a few thousand dollars by leveraging GPT for content generation and translation.\n\nThis investment is now beginning to pay off as our organic traffic grows exponentially üìä. Where we once saw 50 visitors monthly, we're now seeing 250, and we project reaching 1,000 daily visitors within a year.\n\nWe're simultaneously running multiple advertising campaigns across different jurisdictions. Through continuous testing and optimization, we've reduced our cost per lead from $350 to $90 in some markets üí∞. These leads convert into one-time clients, and a percentage of those eventually become core clients who may spend $100,000 in a single month.",

      "body": "You asked about our approach to funding our marketing efforts and scaling our business globally.\n\nOne innovative strategy we've implemented is leveraging our provider network to fund our marketing activities üí°. When we began successfully attracting clients through advertising but lacked sufficient capital to scale these efforts, we approached providers in different jurisdictions with a proposition: purchase a subscription to our service (initially priced at $3,000) üí∞, which we would then invest entirely in marketing to bring them leads.\n\nWe offered a guarantee - if we didn't deliver leads worth that amount, we would refund the difference üõ°Ô∏è. This approach effectively shared the risk of marketing investment with our providers while giving us the capital needed to expand our advertising reach. Over time, as we demonstrated results, we've been able to increase these subscription prices üìà. We started selling annual subscriptions for $1,000, but our most recent offer was priced at $13,000.\n\nThis strategy has been particularly effective for our marketplace model, where maintaining balance between supply (providers) and demand (clients) is crucial ‚öñÔ∏è. Unlike a city-based marketplace like food delivery or ride-sharing where you need to balance restaurants and customers within a single city, our 'city' is the entire world üåç. Our primary focus is facilitating cross-border transactions - connecting clients from one country with providers in another.\n\nThis global nature creates unique scaling challenges. We can't just focus on building a user base in one market; we need sufficient variety across all markets to make our cross-border model work effectively üîÑ. For example, we don't want to just connect American clients with American lawyers - we want to connect American clients with lawyers from Europe, Japan, and China üåè; Japanese clients with lawyers from Europe, China, and Brazil; and so on.\n\nWhile approximately 30-40% of our client base consists of US-based companies üá∫üá∏, our focus is less on geography and more on client profiles - identifying companies at the right stage, in the right industry, with the right IP experience.

In 2021, we brought on a CEO for Europe who was multilingual and had experience working with international companies.\n\nHowever, this proved premature given our product's stage of development ‚ö†Ô∏è. It was essentially a waste of time and money because our product wasn't ready for enterprise-level sales.\n\nSince then, we've reconsidered our approach to international hiring. Currently, we're operating primarily with a local team and focusing on small businesses and early-stage startups üöÄ, which can still be quite profitable in our industry. As we raise our ambitions to target larger enterprise clients, we'll definitely need to hire local sales representatives in different jurisdictions.\n\nWe recently attended a conference in Germany üá©üá™ where we connected with representatives from large European businesses - companies that spend hundreds of millions of dollars on intellectual property annually üí∞. While these enterprise clients are currently beyond our immediate reach, we're laying the groundwork for future relationships. When we're ready to pursue this segment more aggressively, we plan to hire experienced European professionals from the IP industry who can leverage their existing networks and credibility ü§ù.\n\nFor enterprise sales, we'll follow a more traditional approach: local representation, local marketing, local PR, conference attendance, in-person meetings, and direct calls üìû. However, getting to this stage requires us to first succeed with our current, more unconventional approach.\n\nWe've also recently begun investing in PR activities to build our reputation üì∞, particularly in the American market, which remains our primary focus due to its size and spending power. The US market is substantially larger than others in terms of patent volume (second only to China, though China's patents are often lower quality) and service costs üíµ. A single IP transaction in America can generate $25,000 in fees, while European, Asian, and African clients typically spend significantly less.\n\nThroughout our journey, we've found LinkedIn to be a critical communication channel üíº since most of our target audience is active there.
