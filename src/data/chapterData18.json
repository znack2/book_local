      "title": "Key Strategic Takeaways from Skyeng's International Expansion",
      "description": "Successful international expansion in EdTech requires founder-level commitment, systematic market validation before scaling, and deep understanding of local economic realities. The most critical lesson: focus beats breadth - Skyeng's only profitable international markets (Spain and Italy) were those where founders maintained direct involvement rather than delegating to unproven managers. Product-market fit must be re-established for each market, as economic constraints (like Brazil's inability to afford one-on-one classes) may require fundamental business model changes. Rapid multi-market expansion without operational readiness leads to unsustainable unit economics, regardless of strong domestic performance."

The logic behind this choice was straightforward but perhaps not strategically sound: Sasha Larinovsky was launching Yandex.Turkey, so we thought, 'Why not launch Skyeng in Turkey as well?'** 🇹🇷\n\n**Looking back, this attempt was premature.** At that time, we hadn't even established proper business processes within our local operations. The company was still growing rapidly, our management was overloaded, and we lacked sufficient competence at the senior level. Our entire top-tier team wasn't fully assembled in a stable form - we were in an active growth phase.\n\n**The decision to expand internationally stemmed from inexperience rather than strategic planning.** We didn't realize it would be such a challenge. We thought we could handle it with minimal effort - essentially with our 'left hand' - and conquer new markets easily. Additionally, we had easy access to funding at the time, given our rapid growth and the general euphoria around local tech companies globally.\n\n**Rather than being a conscious, well-thought-out decision with clear reasoning and a dedicated team, it was more of a 'why not?' approach.** Sasha found someone he had previously worked with at Yandex in Turkey and brought them in as a manager to 'try a new country.' This person was the sole individual handling Turkey operations. We provided no additional time or resources.\n\n**We realized within about three months that he wasn't performing well as a manager and wasn't delivering results.** The person we hired was more of a middle manager with Yandex experience in launching projects, but he lacked entrepreneurial experience building his own business. The product offering remained the same as our local platform - no localization or adaptation was attempted.",

Our next target was Brazil, around 2018.** 🇧🇷\n\n**Unlike Turkey, this launch wasn't something I personally managed, so I can't provide complete details about the initial decision-making process.** The trigger seemed to be having someone willing to take on the project, combined with the general industry sentiment that 'everyone's going international.' At that time, GetCourse was attempting to enter Latin America, LinguaLeo was discussing Brazil and claiming they would 'beat everyone there,' and there was a widespread belief that Brazil represented a large market where success was almost guaranteed.\n\n**I now realize that Brazil wouldn't have suited the business model we attempted to implement there. We went in with our standard one-on-one class format, but Brazil is simply too economically constrained for that price point. Brazilians couldn't afford one-on-one classes.** 💰\n\n**The Brazil attempt lasted approximately six months, longer than Turkey.** During this period, we did establish some operational infrastructure - there was a functioning funnel, client communication processes, lead generation, and we were running contextual and targeted advertising. Some economies existed, though it was far from viable.\n\n**The cost of client acquisition made scaling impossible.** While we couldn't claim to have found product-market fit with our business model, creating a completely different product from scratch would have been a fundamentally different challenge requiring group-format classes - something that took us considerable time to develop even at home, let alone launching from scratch in a new market with limited resources.",

These represented our most serious international expansion efforts to date.** 🇨🇳🇪🇸\n\n**China Strategy: Our interest in China was sparked by the success of Chinese EdTech companies.** TutorABC had just raised significant funding, and we observed that their market and business model closely resembled what we were doing at home. We saw numerous Chinese companies doing similar work, starting around the same time, but achieving valuations 10 times higher simply because their market was 10 times larger.\n\n**The initiative was managed directly by Khariton (our co-founder), with our strong CPO Misha Karpov leading operations.** This was a project Misha genuinely wanted to pursue - it drove and inspired him, so he relocated to China and lived there during the launch. The team conducted extensive research, sending mystery shoppers to competitors, engaging deeply with market dynamics, and studying competitor know-how.\n\n**Spain Strategy: Spain's selection was, honestly, completely random.** At that time, I had successfully built B2C marketing at Skyeng and hired a CMO who no longer needed my involvement. I found myself somewhat redundant in these areas. Rather than attempting to tackle the entire world simultaneously, I envisioned a country-by-country approach that would eventually create a portfolio of markets.\n\n**This wasn't a systematic strategic decision by Skyeng to enter Spain - it was more my personal decision.** Previous projects had failed because they weren't handled by founders. The logic was that if a founder managed the project, he could probably demonstrate viability with limited resources. **China received the majority of resources compared to Spain.** In our first year in Spain, I worked with just Yulia Filippova and Zhenya Golikova.",

I set a survival-focused objective - reach break-even within approximately one year to prove viability to our CEO Gosha.** 📊\n\n**We encountered several unexpected challenges. Spain had far more Latin American migrants than we anticipated, and Facebook's algorithms, when working with small budgets, optimize primarily for lead submissions.** The cheapest leads come from people with the most free time - typically unemployed individuals and manual laborers rather than skilled professionals with purchasing power. This created a problem where lead generation costs appeared reasonable, but conversion from trial to purchase remained quite low.\n\n**During our first year, we didn't attempt to hire local Spanish-speaking employees.** Instead, we recruited Estern Europe speakers fluent in Spanish and English - essentially bilingual professionals. We were hesitant to hire locally, partly because Spaniards were too expensive, and when we tried hiring Latinos, we encountered significant quality issues.\n\n**After our first year, when I began building a comprehensive strategy, I created a detailed spreadsheet ranking countries by population, average salary, and English proficiency.** This analysis revealed three viable country clusters: Japan and South Korea, Wealthy Arab countries, and Old Europe (France, Spain, Italy). We had miraculously chosen Spain, which featured large cities and income levels higher than our local market.\n\n**To confirm our Spain success wasn't coincidental, we expanded to Italy, leveraging Yulia's Italian language skills. Italy proved our hypothesis within three months, delivering excellent client acquisition costs and retention metrics.** The key difference was that Italy had very few migrant workers who spoke Italian, so our Facebook and Google targeting reached actual locals with higher purchasing power.",

Investors shared insider information that Novakid was performing exceptionally well and growing rapidly. I assumed their growth came from cheaper per-lesson pricing and introduced short lessons into our product matrix without careful testing or rollout.\n\n**Initially, we saw what appeared to be improved conversion rates without LTV decline. In reality, conversion didn't improve - lesson intensity remained the same, so lifetime value in lessons stayed constant. People were simply paying 1.5 to 2 times less for shorter lessons, which negatively impacted our economics.** 💸\n\n**My team also expanded into Latin America and the United States during this period.** We moved into LATAM because we already had Spanish-speaking operations teams, and we launched in the US targeting the Hispanic population. The basic conclusion was that economics worked best in the US and Chile.\n\n**We never conducted deep market research during our rapid expansion phase. We focused more on internal economics and operations.** Research would have been valuable if we had reached the scale-up stage - moving from 'one to ten' rather than 'zero to one.'",
