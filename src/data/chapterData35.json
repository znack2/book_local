So many speakers are coming… My flight is delayed ✈️, so I have time to write you this letter.\n\nI remember about our agreement and I start my story of e-rocket. So, let's begin! 🚀\n\nOur product in Dubai was inspired by the story of online tipping at home 💡. It seemed like a very simple, straightforward product that wasn't too time-consuming or complex to develop, and it provided value to everyone: the client leaving the tip 💰, the waiter receiving it 👨‍🍳, and so on.\n\nIn 2021, the home market was dying 📉. There were four companies competing with each other. The only way they could compete was lowering transaction fees. At that point, these companies started being acquired by banks 🏦. We realized we were already late, and there was no room for us. There was no real reason to enter the home market anymore. Plus, it's always about capitalization. There's no real venture capital market at home — it's minimal 💸. We wanted to create a company with a high valuation internationally, with the possibility of selling it to a bank later. The basic scenario was either to build a clear, fast dividend business and earn passively from transaction fees, or to go the Net Monet route—conquering market share quickly and then selling to a strategic buyer or a large bank 🎯.\n\nWe've conducted around 20 Zoom interviews with people from Dubai 🇦🇪, the UK 🇬🇧, the US 🇺🇸, and Thailand 🇹🇭 (30-40 interviews in total) and realized that there were no real analogs to this product in the world, except at home. So, we started looking at where we could take this business model 🌍.\n\nWe've chosen launching in the MENA region, exactly in Dubai, because:\nIt has a good tax system 📊, it's a fast-growing region with a high average income and a large number of restaurants 🍽️;\nit's geographically convenient 🗺️;\nIt seemed to be easy to set up a company here and we could remotely and quickly set up operations and then expand globally from there 🌐;\nOne of my co-founders was here, walking around restaurants, and noticed they were starting to digitize—they had just begun accepting Apple Pay 📱, for example.\n\nI suppose it's enough for now. Have to go ✈️.",

You asked me if there was a plan or just \"Let's see what happens and move forward\"? Let me continue the story.\n\nThere was a clear plan, of course 📊. Everything was sequential. First, open a company, come here, gather pre-sales, launch the product in parallel, and get the first transaction 💳. Then, go from zero to 20 restaurants and raise investments based on that 🍽️. So, it was a pretty transparent, clear roadmap 🗺️.\n\nHere's how it happened: we opened a company, and about a month later, we came to Dubai 🇦🇪.\nWe came initially as founders 👥.\nSo, we came for two weeks to do the paperwork 📄, and returned back to home. Then we came for a month, started selling, onboarding the first restaurant 🏪, and so on. Then we returned to home again. And the third time, we came and stayed for a year 📅. By then, we had brought in the team, had our first clients, and started building operations. And then we realized we weren't planning to return to home 🏠. So, we stayed there full-time. It was like the first two times were just to solve technical issues, and then we fully committed. You can't build a business in Dubai any other way 💯.\n\nWe conducted remote CSOs and then... We didn't even have a product yet 🚧. We were developing the product in parallel, but we walked into restaurants with a Net Monet check, asking for the operations director, showing them the check, and saying, \"What do you think?\" 💭 Everyone said, \"Great idea, we're ready to launch,\" and we walked through about 100 restaurants with the founder. But it turned out to be a lot of provocation because the Emirati market is specific—they say \"yes, yes,\" but it rarely leads to signing a contract 📝. They don't know how to say no, they like everything, but it doesn't convert into sales 📉. Out of the restaurants we visited, we only connected with about two.\n\nThe budget was all tied to investments because we received the first tranche of about half a million dollars 💰. So, we mapped out a roadmap, hired salespeople, account managers, marketers 👥, and so on, but it turned out that a lot of it didn't work. Cold calls worked for us 📞. We hired telemarketers who scheduled meetings, and then the salespeople on the ground would come in and close the deals. That's what really worked ✅.\n\nNow I end this letter, it's time to refuel ⛽. There is a nice restaurant on the ground floor 🍽️.",

The sales manager, I brought over from home 🏠. The other guy was already in the UAE 🇦🇪, and we just happened to work well together 🤝.\n\nOur goal was to reach those who were ready ASAP ⚡. We started networking, looking for people on LinkedIn 💼, Facebook 📘, and Clubhouse 🎧. We reached out to whoever we could as quickly as possible. We drew a map of where we had connections 🗺️, who worked where, who had friends in the restaurant business 🍽️, and so on. Based on that, we talked to them and gathered feedback 📝.\n\nThere were no strict requirements for the staff 📋. It was more about speed ⚡, and we hired people who had the skills: good English 🗣️, a background in sales 💼, and the ability to learn quickly 🧠. Because you're starting a business in a country where, at that point, we didn't know much about hiring employees 👥, where to do it, or how to pay salaries 💰. It was a minimal experience, and then we figured it out, but it took some time ⏰.\n\nLater, our team became international 🌍—we had people from India 🇮🇳, Africa 🌍. Now it's a mixed team 🎭.\n\nWe hired based on qualifications and what they could bring to the table 💪. There was no preference for cheaper labor 💸, but Dubai is a multinational city 🏙️. We didn't look at nationality, just at their skills and ability to perform as we needed 🎯. Everyone had good spoken and written English 🗣️. That was an important criterion. It was just a given that everything had to be in English 🌐.\n\nYou know, English is a multicultural language, and I'll be speaking English at the conference, too 🎤. I didn't tell you before, but I was invited to the conference as a speaker. I'm a bit nervous ☺️: there are plenty CIS businessmen 👔.",

You asked me, when I started to understand that something wasn't working 🤔.\n\nRealization that something wasn't working probably came around the third month when we weren't growing as fast as we planned 📉, and there wasn't much momentum.\n\nThen, as a startup, you have several hypotheses 💭—maybe we're a new brand, and they don't trust us 🤷‍♂️, or maybe the penetration is low, and we need to create a culture of online tipping 💳. And so on.\n\nThere was a point where we realized things weren't moving as planned 📊, we weren't hitting KPIs, not even our internal goals 🎯.\n\nSo, we thought, \"Let's add this, test that, let's not just focus on restaurants but also beauty salons 💄. Let's not just collect tips but also reviews ⭐. Let's push reviews to Google Maps 🗺️.\" So, we started approaching it product-wise, adding various features iteratively 🔄. Anyway, around 6-7 months gone ⏰, we objectively realized that as a standalone product it wasn't going to take off 🚀. So, we started adding... We went to restaurants, asked what their pain points were 😫, what they wanted to add, and started developing other products based on that feedback 💡.\n\nFor this, I think, it's important to understand that you can't really test this remotely 🌐. Remote case studies are useless because they don't lead to contracts 📝. If I had signed contracts over calls ☎️, then it would have worked. So, we started following a model where we sell something first, then implement and sell it differently 🔄.\n\nBut it doesn't work otherwise. Because they'll say something nice, say, \"Yes, interesting,\" but when it comes to the contract, it just doesn't convert 📉. Plus, you have to understand the specifics of the Emirati market—everything takes a long time ⏰, the sales system doesn't work like at home or Europe because they don't have a culture of saying no 🙅‍♂️, they're very afraid of making reputational decisions. Dubai is a city where people come and go 🚪; it's easy to set up a company, take the money, and leave 💸. And their management doesn't think in terms of metrics 📊, where you come in, and the manager says, \"Guys, I need to increase the average check 💰. What can you offer?\" Or, \"I have a large customer base 👥, but I'm not doing anything with it. Do you have a solution?\" 💡\n\nWell, got to go now ✈️. Prepare all the stuff for my presentation 📊.",

I have some free time before going to the conference closing ceremony 🎊, so let's finish the e-rocket story. You've asked me if the plan was based on something we did in the home market (like Nochka or others) or if it was a specific plan for Dubai 🇦🇪.\n\nI can tell that the first financial model we drew up was, of course, based on Nochka 📊, which managed to connect 13-15 thousand restaurants in three years 🍽️. Then we underestimate ourselves 😅.\n\nFirst, it turned out that Dubai and the UAE are a relatively small market 📏—about 20 thousand restaurants, compared to 200 thousand at home 🏠. And it turned out that they weren't that quick to adopt technology 📱.\n\nLater, if we jump ahead ⏭️, we didn't achieve product-market fit with the online tipping technology 💳. If there wasn't rapid market conquest 🚀, we changed the model, tested different hypotheses 🧪, reconfigured the system, like payment systems 💰, and so on. But it turned out that, as a standalone product, online tipping didn't spread as quickly in the UAE 🇦🇪.\n\nIt's not that we failed ❌, but over time, because we were the first to launch this and probably the fastest ⚡, especially when the war started ⚔️, other teams came in trying to follow the same path, but everyone failed, and no one succeeded 😔.\n\nIt's not a mistake—it just turned out to be the wrong market, wrong timing ⏰. We didn't achieve product-market fit 🎯. We had a hypothesis that, I'd say, wasn't confirmed ❌. That's the right way to put it. Because we're a startup 🚀, we set hypotheses, and this one didn't work out.\n\nProbably, the right move would have been to enter with a different product from the start 🔄. After several iterations, we arrived at what we're doing now, and we realized we should have either launched a different product or entered a different market 🌍. Right away, probably the US market 🇺🇸, because it's more capitalized 💰, has a developed venture ecosystem 🏦, and is statistically larger 📊. But if we're talking about MENA 🌍, it's a big market too—there's Saudi Arabia 🇸🇦, Egypt 🇪🇬, which also have good potential 📈.\n\nIf you have any more questions, let me know ❓.\n\nHope to see you soon! 👋",
