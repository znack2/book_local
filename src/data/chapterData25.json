With experience from the Displayer company's international operations and four years in AI development, Roma pioneered one of the first ML studios in his local market. He later founded Optica.com, developing AI Note for music platform fraud detection, and currently leads a biotech venture focused on drug discovery for pharmaceutical companies. Roma divides his time between Dubai and San Francisco, embodying the international entrepreneur lifestyle he always envisioned."

      "description": "BeOptic's journey reveals critical lessons for AI startups expanding internationally. Key insights include: Physical presence is non-negotiable for B2B sales - remote selling rarely works in international markets, especially MENA and America. Cultural adaptation goes beyond language - understanding meeting preferences, communication styles, and business relationship dynamics is essential. Hackathons and competitions provide powerful market entry strategies, offering visibility and instant credibility as domain experts. Hiring non-native speakers early forces English adoption and global mindset development. Market research should balance analytics with rapid execution - over-analysis can paralyze small studios that need to move fast. Geographic and political factors significantly impact market access - Qatar's regional conflicts limited expansion despite initial success. For serious global expansion, founders must commit fully to living in target markets rather than managing remotely."

I already had experience with international markets from the Displayer company, which had operations in America üá∫üá∏ and production in China üá®üá≥. I saw how hard it was - our guys lived there for weeks, someone was constantly deceiving us.\n\nI always dreamed of living the life I have now - flying a lot ‚úàÔ∏è, traveling extensively. This freedom of movement has materialized into flights, negotiations, and different countries. Dubai is now my most convenient base - I live there and spend about 4 months in San Francisco üåâ with many business trips.\n\nAt that time, <a href='https://eora.ai'>EORA</a> was one of the first machine learning studios in our local market, if not the first. We'd been working in AI for about four years and felt the desire to try ourselves internationally as a studio since we didn't have products, just expertise. We don't have investors - EORA was initially founded by me, then partners appeared. There was no external push. I wanted to be international, do something big, global. üöÄ",

They're much simpler than Indians üáÆüá≥ or especially Chinese üá®üá≥. I still believe the Middle East and Africa will grow rapidly because it's the only place where cheap labor is preserved. People there still live on $5 üíµ, so capitalism in neoclassical form is possible.\n\nWe didn't do much cabinet research. China and India have huge AI competition. London looked interesting, but we were afraid we wouldn't handle it financially - setting up a studio there would be expensive üí∏. The Middle East seemed attractive - they're open to innovation, need AI, and everything is tied to dollars üí∞, which is very profitable and easy with legal entities and banks.\n\nI'm from the category of people who are about ideas üí°, not just money.

When you win them consistently, it can work because you show yourself as an expert üß†. We went to Qatar-Con - the first hackathon in Qatar's history. Why MENA specifically? In Innopolis where we had an office, there were many Egyptians and Syrians. It was easy to get expertise from Arabic speakers üó£Ô∏è. I knew we could build an Arabic subdivision since they all speak Arabic naturally.\n\nWe won the first hackathon in Qatar's history ü•á, which gave us many connections. We met everyone - universities üéì, tech parks (there are two there). We agreed on starting a company there. But we miscalculated. There were conflicts between the Emirates and Qatar üåä, and I thought they were establishing relations. I believed that from a Qatari company, you could work with any MENA market.

Otherwise, you won't grow into global culture. The earlier you go through this painful process - when it's easier to discuss everything in your home language but you switch completely to English - the better üí™.\n\nFor international markets, sales, marketing, PR, project management all should be local üìç. Developers can be local. We had account functions in projects - if you ordered a project from us, first you had onboarding with sales accounts, then a project manager reports to you. We didn't split this into two people because clients want to know exactly what's happening, and the client speaks Arabic or English üó£Ô∏è.",

You need to come with something marginal like web3 exchange where super margin matters üíé, but you depend on tax arbitrage.\n\nI'd look for local guys up to 45 who sit on top of developers or banks üëî. Come up with some product so everyone goes crazy - like contact lenses with built-in displays üëÅÔ∏è or holography. Something with a strong wow factor so Dubai can say we're the best in the world again üåü. If you're doing some B2B SaaS contact center operator - zero chances ‚ùå. But if you're doing next gen robot-system or medicine ü§ñüíä - these things they're ready for.\n\nYou need to understand that everything depends on your specificity üéØ. The better you segment - B2B, SaaS or specific market - the more accurate the prediction will be. Every business model is different - stores, delivery services, factories üè≠. These companies require completely different approaches.\n\nIn B2B, presence matters everywhere üìç. You can't sell systematically without being there. In B2C, you can probably work remotely, but in B2B it's completely different.",

        "description": "Roma figured out Dubai's secret: they LOVE being the coolest and most advanced place in the world! Instead of competing with boring business software (where they'll pick cheaper options), bring something so amazing that Dubai can brag about having it first. It's like bringing the newest, coolest toy to show-and-tell - everyone wants to see it and be associated with it. Dubai wants to be known for having the most futuristic stuff, so if you can help them look like the most advanced city on Earth, they'll pay attention to you!"

If I'm not ready to live in America, I'd do deep tech B2G and try something in Dubai - some big B2G project üèõÔ∏è.\n\nStrategy for America: hammer top accelerators until you get into <a href='https://www.ycombinator.com/'>Y Combinator</a> üéØ. Move only through Y Combinator or Alchemist. I'd gather money for life and survival üí∞, collect $25-30k angel funding - in America they can write this check in a caf√© ‚òï. I'd run through the valley, pitch everywhere üó£Ô∏è, train to pitch, keep two developers in the CIS motivated, and work with fanatics.\n\nYou need money so chances are at least reasonable for a year of life üìÖ. You'll suck everything for a year, most likely need two years ‚è∞. If you have a studio model, you'll never attract serious money üí∏. It's strange to invest in a studio just like that.\n\nAbout product market fit on international markets - it's the hardest to get üéØ. At home it's difficult, abroad it's many times more difficult because the probability of errors is higher ‚ùå. But who said it would be easy?

If yes, then focus everything on getting into Y Combinator and conquering the world from Silicon Valley. If no, then focus on big government projects in places like Dubai. It's like choosing between joining the NBA (you have to move to America and play by their rules) or becoming the best player in your local league. Both can work, but they require totally different strategies and commitments!"
