      "description": "This expansion story teaches us that successful international growth requires three key ingredients: choosing the right market through careful research (UAE's 30% e-commerce growth made it perfect), building a strong team that can adapt (keeping 35 out of 50 people and retraining them), and focusing on the right business metrics (LTV-to-CAC ratio instead of just growth). The most surprising lesson? Sometimes external events make decisions for you - when the war started, Germany was no longer an option, making UAE the clear choice. The secret sauce was treating competitors as partners rather than enemies, which multiplied their delivery capacity without extra investment."

      "body": "You asked about how our international expansion journey began and what motivated us to focus on markets outside the home market. Let me share our story.\n\nOur international journey has its roots in a partnership between experienced entrepreneurs with complementary backgrounds. My partner, Oleg Dashkevich, had built businesses in the home market for 19 years, starting with Retail, then a development company, and later a premium shoe marketplace 👠 with partners. Although the shoe marketplace struggled against well-funded competitors like Sapato and Lamoda, the experience provided valuable lessons.\n\nOleg went on to launch a successful organic delivery service called Logsis, which continues to operate profitably at home. However, he maintained his dream of creating a marketplace with rapid delivery ⚡ - envisioning filled with \"red little men\" quickly delivering orders, combining his marketplace and logistics expertise.\n\nIn November 2021 I was at a career crossroads after deciding to leave Yandex following seven and a half years there. My background was deeply rooted in e-commerce and logistics 📦 - before Yandex, I had worked at a logistics e-commerce startup, and at Yandex I launched Yandex.delivery, worked on Yandex.market, and in my final year managed the integration of delivery services.\n\nWhen we began discussions, I saw a strong alignment not just in business experience but in our vision for development and creating useful products for people 🎯. However, I had ethical considerations about competing with Yandex in the home market. This became one of my conditions for joining - I wouldn't hunt people from Yandex, and I wanted to ensure we maintained eco-friendly relationships.\n\nAfter initial discussions with my friend who represented an investment fund 💰, we realized that focusing solely on the home market wasn't strategically sound. We understood how much investment companies like Yandex and players like Ozon pour into marketplace development. This analytical perspective helped us pivot our thinking toward international markets.\n\nIn December 2021, we began actively researching international opportunities, with me officially joining the team in November. Our fundamental decision was to focus entirely on international markets rather than dividing our attention, as the business model requires significant focus due to its complexity - including digital components, courier operations, warehousing, and product handling.\n\nThis was the start of our journey toward selecting the right international market for our e-commerce marketplace vision.",

      "body": "You asked about our market selection process and how we identified which international markets to target. This was a methodical approach involving multiple factors and stages of evaluation.\n\nOur market selection began with consultations with experts from the investment industry - both American and CIS funds, as well as private investors from my network 🤝. These discussions provided crucial guidance on which markets were actively developing, which had realistic entry points, and which were exceptionally challenging for operational e-commerce business (like India and China 🚫).\n\nSince our marketplace was conceived as an investment project with initial capital of just over a million dollars 💵 (substantial but insufficient for marketplace development without additional funding), we prioritized markets where raising capital for growth would be feasible. This became our first selection criterion.\n\nOur second criterion was market accessibility for new solutions. Markets like China and India were immediately excluded despite their size because they either required insider presence or massive funding to penetrate effectively.\n\nThe third criterion was the competitive landscape 🥊 - for example, while the United States presented a huge opportunity, the intense competition there made entry prohibitively difficult.\n\nThrough this initial filtering, we narrowed our focus to four markets:\n1. United Kingdom 🇬🇧\n2. Germany 🇩🇪\n3. Canada 🇨🇦\n4. United Arab Emirates 🇦🇪\n\nFor each market, we identified founders who had launched similar solutions, including both founders and local entrepreneurs. We engaged with them to understand specifics about forming businesses in those markets.\n\nThis process further narrowed our shortlist to two primary targets:\n- United Arab Emirates (with potential expansion to the broader MENA region)\n- Germany (with potential expansion to other European countries)\n\nBoth markets showed significant e-commerce development potential and sizable populations 👥. The MENA region encompasses over 170 million people across seven key countries, while Europe offers a similarly attractive cross-section of potential customers.\n\nWe began testing both markets simultaneously in a resource-efficient manner. We launched landing pages in both Germany and the Emirates to gauge seller interest in connecting to our platform 📊. The testing period ran from December through February, and both markets showed promising indicators.\n\nWhile we were still evaluating both options, external events made the decision for us. When the SMO (Special Military Operation) was announced in February, we immediately recognized that Germany was no longer viable, leaving the Emirates as our sole focus.\n\nBy March, we had prepared our team and relocated key members to Dubai to begin implementation of our marketplace vision in the UAE market 🏙️.\n\nThis structured approach to market selection, combining expert consultation, competitive analysis, and practical testing, gave us confidence in our ultimate focus on the UAE as our launch market.",

      "body": "You asked about how we transformed our team for international expansion and what specific skills and capabilities we prioritized. This was indeed a significant challenge requiring careful consideration.\n\nOur initial team comprised approximately 50 people who had been working on the local version of the marketplace. As we pivoted to international markets, we needed to reconfigure this team for our new direction. We ultimately said goodbye to about 15 employees, who weren't required for our international focus.\n\nThe remaining 35 team members formed our core, with most being developers and product specialists 💻. However, we didn't simply maintain the status quo - we implemented several strategic approaches to team development:\n\n**1. Retraining Rather Than Replacing 🔄**\nInstead of wholesale replacement, we identified talented team members who could be retrained and redirected to new functions. For example, some customer service representatives with strong English skills were transferred to account management for connecting new sellers, while others moved to the HR department. This approach not only preserved institutional knowledge but created a powerful motivational component as people embraced new challenges.\n\n**2. English Language Development 🗣️**\nEnglish proficiency became a unifying force for the team. Since all work and communication was conducted remotely, the shared experience of improving English skills created strong bonds among team members. Many employees advanced several levels in their language proficiency and now confidently handle work issues in English.\n\n**3. Strategic New Hires 🎯**\nFor new positions, we established clear criteria:\n- English/Arabic proficiency in customers service\n- Experience in both startups and established corporations\n- Mobility and willingness to potentially relocate\n\n**4. Multifunctional Leadership 👨‍💼**\nWe specifically sought leaders who could handle multiple significant areas of responsibility simultaneously - a crucial quality in a startup environment. For example, about six months into our Dubai operations, we brought on a powerful operations director who had previously scaled local operations at KupiVIP from 40 orders to 10,000 orders daily, then built Dostavista into the #2 player in the home market.\n\n**5. Internal Development 📈**\nWe've also seen significant internal growth. Our HR director has been promoted to manage two lines of business. Our former B2B product manager from Yandex and Avito grew into the CPO role, selected by the team to lead the product direction.\n\n**6. Local Talent Integration 🌍**\nAs we established operations in Dubai, we began hiring local specialists - particularly Arabic-speaking sales managers to lead key customer and partner relationships in client services, B2B account management, and product teams. These local hires have been essential for navigating the cultural intricacies of the market.\n\nInterestingly, when evaluating senior leadership candidates from the region, we found that many international executives from corporate backgrounds weren't well-suited to the startup environment. They often seemed uncomfortable leaving their comfort zones or engaging in the out-of-the-box thinking necessary in a fast-moving startup where company success depends on work efficiency rather than corporate budgets 💡.\n\nThis comprehensive approach to team transformation - combining retraining, strategic hiring, and internal development - has been crucial to our successful market entry and growth.",

      "body": "You asked about our approach to market research and strategy development for the UAE. This was a multi-layered process that evolved over time as we gained deeper insights into the market.\n\nWe conducted our research in several waves beginning in December 2021:\n1. **First wave:** Analysis of open analytical reporting and market access data 📋\n2. **Second wave (January):** Engagement with research companies and purchase of paid reports 💰\n3. **Third wave (February):** Launch of landing pages to test market response 🧪\n4. **Fourth wave (March):** On-the-ground validation and implementation 🚀\n\nA critical component of our research was Oleg's personal visit to Dubai in February, where he directly experienced the market as a consumer - ordering deliveries, exploring retail establishments, visiting dark store warehouses, and observing operations firsthand 👀. This combination of data analysis and personal experience proved invaluable.\n\nThrough our research, we identified two significant market gaps that would become our entry points:\n\n**1. Express Delivery Opportunity ⚡**\nWe discovered that 95% of e-commerce categories in the UAE operated on 1-5 day delivery timeframes. This represented a clear opportunity to introduce express delivery as a differentiator in a market where it simply didn't exist.\n\n**2. Predictive Delivery Window ⏰**\nWe also identified customer frustration with having to wait all day for deliveries. This led us to develop predictive delivery functionality allowing customers to select specific time slots on days convenient for them - a feature that still doesn't exist among our competitors.\n\nOur strategy development was guided by five key principles:\n\n**1. Ecosystem Approach 🌐**\nWe recognized that standalone marketplaces often take 7-10 years to reach break-even. Our strategy instead focused on building an ecosystem and classic super-app to achieve medium-term profitability. By bringing customers into our ecosystem once and then increasing their frequency and monetization, we could achieve sustainable growth.\n\n**2. Strategic Assortment Selection 🛍️**\nChoosing the right product assortment was critical for achieving favorable unit economics. For example, we deliberately delayed our grocery delivery launch until our second year in the market, as grocery delivery typically has extremely high customer acquisition costs paired with lower average checks.\n\n**3. Unique Market Entry Points 🎯**\nBeyond express and predictive delivery, we also focused on curating assortment that wasn't available online elsewhere in the Emirates. While this unique assortment represents only about 10% of our offerings, these items serve as \"locomotives\" that attract customers to our platform.\n\n**4. Customer Experience Focus 😊**\nWe employed methodologies like \"Jobs to be Done\" to deeply understand customer pain points and needs, tracing their psychology and behavioral patterns to create a superior experience.\n\n**5. Trend Identification 📈**\nWe developed systems to identify emerging trends before they become mainstream, allowing us to capitalize on growth opportunities early.\n\nOne significant realization that came later in our journey was the importance of collaboration over competition 🤝. By our second year, we began signing partnerships even with competitors - for example, Careem now carries our delivery orders, effectively adding ten thousand couriers to our network. This approach of strengthening through partnerships has become a cornerstone of our strategy.\n\nThis comprehensive research and strategic approach has allowed us to establish a distinctive position in the UAE market and build a foundation for sustained growth.",

      "body": "You asked about how we adapted our approach for the UAE market compared to our original home market experience. While there are significant similarities in marketplace fundamentals, the adaptations required for successful international expansion have been substantial.\n\nLet me highlight the key similarities and differences:\n\n**Core Similarities 🔄:**\n1. **Marketplace Fundamentals:** The basic rules of marketplace operation remain constant - 1P, 3P, DPS, FBS models work the same way globally\n2. **Ecosystem Thinking:** The focus on customer retention and lifetime value is universal\n3. **Company Culture:** I've maintained an index-like culture similar to what I experienced at Yandex - building around meanings and values rather than rigid hierarchies\n\n**Key Differences 🌟:**\n\n**1. Client Mentality 🧠**\nWhile the country mates share similar mentalities despite ethnic differences, the Emirates presents a vastly different psychological landscape. Even after three years in the market, we're still working to fully understand the mentality of segments like our Indian customers - though this challenge also presents the opportunity to eventually access markets like India through this understanding.\n\n**2. Competitor Relationships 🤝**\nAt home, partnerships with competitors were virtually unthinkable. In the UAE, especially among founders, there's a surprising openness and willingness to cooperate. Being \"foreigners\" creates a sense of kinship that transcends competition, leading to information sharing and mutual strengthening.\n\n**3. Business Transaction Cycles ⏱️**\nWhen working with local businesses (primarily owned by Indians, Pakistanis, and occasionally Emiratis), the transaction cycles are significantly longer. Many business relationships are built through \"brotherly relations\" - I've experienced meetings with large distributors where negotiations begin in English with me as CEO, then transition to Arabic with our Arabic-speaking sales manager, concluding with handshakes and relationship-building.\n\n**4. Technology Adaptation 💻**\nMany large distributors in the region lack proper automation, operating with semi-automated processes at best. This contrasts sharply with the experience of connecting companies like Askona, Vkusvill, or Polaris, which are typically fast, clear, specific, and decisive in their integration.\n\n**5. Issue Resolution Timeframes ⏰**\nThere's a notable cultural difference in how quickly issues are addressed and resolved, with significantly longer timeframes being the norm in the UAE market.\n\n**6. Sales Approach 💼**\nThe relationship-building components of sales are much more prominent, with human relations and personal connections often taking precedence over purely transactional considerations.\n\nThese adaptations have required significant flexibility and learning from our team. We've had to recalibrate expectations around timeframes, develop new relationship-building skills, and create systems that can accommodate the technological diversity of our partners.\n\nPerhaps our most consequential adaptation has been the shift from viewing competitors as adversaries to seeing them as potential collaborators 🌈. This mindset shift has opened doors to partnerships that multiply our capabilities without requiring proportional investment in infrastructure.\n\nUnderstanding and adapting to these differences has been essential to our success in the UAE market and will continue to guide our approach as we expand further into the MENA region.",

      "body": "You asked about our performance targets, how we measure success, and what metrics convinced us to continue when we faced early challenges. These are excellent questions that get to the heart of our business approach.\n\nFrom the beginning, we established clear performance targets centered around unit economics rather than simply pursuing gross merchandise value (GMV) or revenue growth 📈. Our primary goal was to achieve a specific LTV-to-CAC ratio - ideally reaching at least 1:1 (break-even) or better yet, exceeding that threshold.\n\nThis focus on unit economics rather than pure growth metrics was deliberate and strategic 🎯. In e-commerce, GMV and revenue are heavily dependent on marketing expenditure - you can always grow these metrics by increasing your marketing budget, but this approach isn't sustainable without underlying profitability. Our target ratio demonstrates whether we've built a business model with positive unit economics that could:\n\n1. Support marketing investment to capture market share 💰\n2. Be taken to profitability in medium term period ⏰\n\n**Why Unit Economics Matter More Than Growth 🧠:**\n\nWhile many startups get excited about big revenue numbers, we learned that smart money 💡 cares more about whether each customer actually makes you money in the long run. Think of it like this: if you spend $100 to get a customer, but that customer only gives you back $80 over their lifetime, you're losing $20 on every \"successful\" sale!\n\nThe LTV (Lifetime Value) to CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) ratio tells you the real story. A healthy ratio is at least 3:1, meaning every $1 you spend on getting customers should return at least $3 over time. We aimed for at least 1:1 initially, which means breaking even.\n\n**What Convinced Us to Keep Going 🚀:**\n\nWe continued with our strategy because we observed several encouraging trends:\n\n1. Strong growth trajectories across key metrics 📊\n2. Improving efficiency in customer acquisition 🎯\n3. Increasing customer retention and repeat purchase rates 🔄\n4. Clear path to positive unit economics 💡\n\nThese indicators gave us confidence that our model was fundamentally sound and that the delay in reaching our target ratio was a matter of timing rather than a structural flaw in our approach. The positive momentum in our core metrics justified continued investment and expansion.\n\nOur decision to pursue an ecosystem rather than a pure marketplace approach has been validated by these results. By focusing on customer retention and increasing purchase frequency within our ecosystem, we're building a more sustainable business model than we could achieve through a single-service approach.\n\n**The Ecosystem Strategy Advantage 🌐:**\n\nInstead of just being a marketplace where people buy things once in a while, we built an ecosystem - like a mini Amazon that does many things. This way, once customers trust us for one service, they use us for others too. It's much cheaper to sell more things to existing happy customers than to find completely new customers every time!\n\nFor companies considering international expansion, I would emphasize the importance of establishing clear, economics-based metrics rather than pursuing growth at all costs. The ability to build a model that can be profitable in the medium term provides both strategic flexibility and a stronger foundation for sustainable growth.\n\nAs we continue to expand our services and reach within the MENA region, we maintain this disciplined focus on unit economics while pursuing ambitious growth. This balanced approach has allowed us to weather challenges and continue building a business with long-term viability 🌟.",
