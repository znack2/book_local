Unlike many companies that start locally and then expand, we targeted the global market from the beginning, with the United States 🇺🇸 as our primary focus.\n\nThe decision to focus on the US was primarily driven by the economics of business automation. Since our solution's ROI is directly tied to the alternative cost of hiring employees, we knew we could earn significantly more from small businesses in the US than from small businesses in domestic market, where salaries are lower. This economic reality shaped our entire go-to-market strategy. 💰📊\n\nWhile I had already been living in the US for 16 years, my co-founder Sergey moved to the US specifically to incorporate the company and establish our presence there. This was a fundamental decision - we firmly believed that if you're building a product for a specific market, you need to be physically present there. It's incredibly difficult to succeed in the American market if you're operating remotely from elsewhere. 🏢🇺🇸\n\nOur first clients in the US were truly small businesses - including a bank with just 25 employees - whereas at home, we ended up working primarily with mid-market companies because the economics made more sense at that scale. 🏦👥\n\nThe contrast was striking: we could charge much higher prices in the US because the alternative cost of hiring additional employees was so much greater. This fundamental economic insight drove everything from our pricing strategy to our market selection approach. 💡💼",

Instead, we leveraged insider knowledge from our previous experience in the industry. Both my co-founder and I had worked with enterprise-level RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions - he as an integrator business owner and myself within large integration businesses. 🤖💼\n\nWe knew there was a major enterprise player (UiPath) dominating the market, but we also recognized that smaller companies had similar automation needs that weren't being adequately addressed. UiPath understood this demand too, but as they'd already grown to a billion-dollar company, they had little interest in the SMB segment. 🎯📈\n\nThis perceived gap gave us confidence to enter the market. We set an ambitious goal: close our first deal in America within six months. This timeline was partly driven by our product development schedule - we needed to demonstrate traction with our current product capabilities to make credible claims about future potential. ⏰🚀\n\nRather than investing heavily in formal research, we prioritized direct sales outreach and customer conversations. In our experience, customer development without sales opportunities isn't particularly valuable - real insights come from people who are genuinely interested in solving the problems you address. 💬📞\n\nOur entire budget during this initial phase went to developers at home, while Sergey bootstrapped his US presence himself. There was no specific contingency plan if we couldn't achieve our targets - we were confident in the fundamental need for automation and believed that any failure would be in our approach rather than market demand. 💪🎯",

      "body": "Regarding your question about adjusting our sales approach for the American market - we definitely had to make significant changes compared to our home operations.\n\nThe most immediate change was in our marketing creative. While in the CIS we leveraged the \"ElectroNeek\" name and its playful associations, we quickly abandoned certain elements (like \"two guys in tracksuits\") when entering the American market. We needed to clearly communicate what we were selling without cultural references that wouldn't translate. 🎨🇺🇸\n\nHowever, we did continue using some core visual assets across markets. For example, our value proposition videos showing how scattered data and repetitive tasks could be automated worked well in the CIS and English-speaking markets. 🎥💡\n\nThe deeper difference was in the sales process itself. In America, it's much harder to sell \"dreams\" to SMBs than in the CIS. American businesses generally want proof before commitment - they insist on seeing tangible results before purchasing. This stands in stark contrast to the home market, where clients were more willing to buy into the vision of automation without extensive demonstration. 🏗️📊\n\nWe could offer highly controlled, short trials because clients were more receptive to the concept at home. In America, we needed to prove value much more concretely before customers would commit. This made our products more compensatory in the US market, but also made channel building more challenging. ⚖️🎯\n\nThis insight led us to invest heavily in case studies and tangible examples - something we didn't initially prioritize but later recognized as crucial for the American market. We eventually created a library of bots, categorized our products, and developed specific use cases that resonated with SMB clients. These concrete, demonstrable solutions proved far more effective than abstract promises of efficiency. 📚🤖✨",

      "body": "Your question about our geographic strategy within the US touches on an important aspect of our approach. While we sell a SaaS solution that can theoretically be sold anywhere, we made deliberate choices about where to focus our efforts.\n\nNew York became our initial base of operations for specific reasons. For our type of IT tool, clients need people with development skills to create automation workflows. We analyzed where these skills were concentrated and discovered that New York had approximately 60% remote workers in this industry. This data-driven decision guided Sergey's relocation to New York. 🗽📊\n\nAs we expanded, we continued to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator to identify areas with high concentrations of IT service companies and specialists. This analysis pointed us toward states like Texas 🤠 and Colorado 🏔️ as promising expansion markets. Our approach was methodical rather than random - we looked for regions with the right talent density to support our product adoption.\n\nWhen it came to hiring our first sales staff for the American market, we made another strategic decision. Rather than trying to sell with foreign accents and cultural references that might create psychological barriers, we hired Native Americans who could easily pass what I call \"the test of being a stranger.\" This significantly improved our ability to connect with prospects. 🇺🇸🤝\n\nInterestingly, we discovered that we could hire American salespeople who were willing to work remotely. For entry-level sales roles like follow-up calls, we focused on hiring recent college graduates who were articulate, presented well, and could quickly demonstrate our product during sales interactions. 🎓📞\n\nOur strategy wasn't immediately successful - we had to train and adjust our approach significantly. However, this foundation eventually allowed us to build an effective sales operation in the American market. 📈💪",

      "body": "I wanted to address your question about our channel strategy evolution - the shift to working with integrators was indeed transformative for our business.\n\nOur most significant insight came when we pivoted from selling directly to small businesses to focusing on integrators who work with small businesses. This wasn't just a minor adjustment - it represented a fundamental change in both our product and go-to-market strategy. 🔄🎯\n\nThe catalyst for this shift was the COVID-19 pandemic 🦠. During this challenging period, customers became much more selective about their purchases, only buying what they genuinely needed. This forced us to reevaluate our approach, looking not just at customer acquisition but at how to derive more value from each relationship.\n\nWe realized that when we sold our software to an integrator for their first project, a successful implementation often led to a second project, then a third, fourth, and fifth. Essentially, we could \"sell\" five times to the same company through their various client implementations, rather than being limited to a single SMB's needs. 📈🔥\n\nIntegrators solve a critical problem in the SMB automation space: they ensure solutions are used effectively, provide quality support, and identify new implementation opportunities. This keeps churn under control and allows for positive expansion within the SMB segment - something that's extremely difficult to achieve through direct sales. 🛡️📊\n\nThe integrator channel varies significantly across markets - what works at the home market differs from the US, which differs from Latin America. Understanding these distinctions has been crucial to our international growth. When integrators saw the same opportunity we did - demand from SMBs that couldn't afford enterprise solutions - they were motivated to partner with us. We offered them a channel to serve this market segment effectively. 🌍🤝\n\nThis approach became even more powerful when integrators recognized they could use our tools for their own business operations. By pulling the right strings and presenting our solution correctly, we built strong relationships with integrators at a very early stage in our company's development. 💡🚀",

      "body": "You asked about our expansion beyond the US market - this occurred somewhat organically through our integrator relationships rather than through a deliberate country-by-country strategy.\n\nOur business became global almost automatically once we started working with American integrators, as many had development teams in other countries. These integrators often worked with English-speaking developers regardless of their location, which simplified our initial expansion. 🌍🇺🇸\n\nThe real complexity arose when we started working with integrators in non-English-speaking countries like Latin America 🌎. These partners typically worked with clients in their local languages - Spanish and Portuguese - creating needs for localized support, sales, presales, and product translation.\n\nLocalizing our product was a significant investment, though it's become easier with tools like GPT. This expansion focus was part of our Series A funding round, which specifically targeted new international markets. 💰🤖\n\nOur decision to expand beyond the US was driven by return on investment calculations. When setting growth targets, we might project that 70% would come from the US market and 30% from international, or perhaps a 50/50 split depending on opportunities. If we could quickly turn acquisition investments into upfront license revenue in Latin America while continuing our US growth, it made financial sense to pursue both simultaneously. 📊⚖️\n\nInterestingly, the economic conditions in regions like Latin America actually enhanced our value proposition in some ways. Because local economies are often weaker than North America's, our software can provide even stronger ROI for the same price (or even half the price), making it more compelling in these markets. 💪💰\n\nEach new market required adaptation of our approach. By the time we entered Latin America, our US sales strategy had already evolved significantly from our initial entry. The success of local operations depends greatly on how well regional management can independently adapt global models to local conditions. 🎯🌟",

We didn't invest enough in developing comprehensive case studies early on, which made selling horizontal automation solutions more challenging than necessary. 📊❌\n\nWhen we finally created a proper library of bots, categorized our products, and developed specific use cases for SMB clients, our sales process became much more effective. This tangible, results-focused approach resonates strongly with American buyers. 🤖📚✅\n\nWe also discovered interesting cultural differences in how people interact with business tools. For instance, American sales teams seem less diligent about entering information into CRM systems compared to their counterparts elsewhere. These subtle cultural variations can significantly impact product adoption and usage patterns. 💻🇺🇸\n\nOffice environments played an unexpected role in our sales effectiveness. During the COVID period, we operated remotely, but when we later established a local office in San Francisco, we noticed that in-person sales teams were charged with more energy and performed better than their remote counterparts. Though this observation isn't scientifically proven, it influenced our approach to team structure. 🏢⚡\n\nPerhaps our most fundamental insight is about physical presence in your target market. If you want to succeed in the American market, you simply must be there - not managing remotely from Portugal or elsewhere. Being physically close to your buyers doesn't guarantee success, but being far away significantly reduces your chances. This is especially true for founders who don't have established family ties, pensions, or other anchors in their home countries. 🌍🎯\n\nFor startups in any market, motivating high-caliber talent requires more than just money. Creating the right culture becomes essential if you want to build a sustainable company and retain top performers over the long term. While this might seem obvious, implementing it effectively remains one of the more challenging aspects of international expansion. 💪🏆",

      "body": "Although our conversation focused primarily on our US expansion, I wanted to share some insights about the Latin American market that might be valuable if you're considering expansion into that region.\n\nA fundamental characteristic of Latin American business culture, particularly in Brazil 🇧🇷 (the region's largest market), is their strong desire for innovation and unique identity. When hiring employees or selling to clients in this region, you'll quickly discover that they resist standardized solutions and crave the opportunity to create something new, even for routine business processes.\n\nFor example, if you ask a Brazilian employee to create a kanban board, they'll likely design their own version rather than using an existing template. They want recognition for innovation, even in relatively standard tools. If they can't put their own stamp on something, they may resist or even quietly sabotage the task. 🎨💡\n\nThis same pattern extends to clients. Unlike in other regions, saving money or increasing efficiency isn't necessarily the most compelling value proposition. Instead, Latin American businesses want solutions designed specifically for them - they resist the idea of using the same tools as everyone else. This explains why many global SaaS companies struggle to gain traction in Brazil despite success elsewhere. 🎯🤔\n\nThis cultural trait is visible throughout Brazilian society. Almost all shops, restaurants, and businesses are named after their founders rather than operated as chains. There's very little standardization - everything is personalized and local. While Coca-Cola is available, most Brazilians prefer local cola brands. This extends to architecture as well; you'll find virtually no public buildings designed by foreign architects throughout Brazil. 🏗️🏪\n\nAnother critical factor is the need for extensive onboarding support. Clients in this region often require extraordinary levels of hand-holding even after purchasing expensive solutions. A company might buy an enterprise software package for tens of thousands of dollars, then immediately request comprehensive training because \"we don't know how it works.\" This support is typically provided free of charge in Latin America, unlike the US where such training is often billable. 🤝📚\n\nMost successful SaaS companies in this region operate through partners or integrators, with the vendor providing marketing to generate leads that partners then convert into sales. This model works particularly well because partners already understand the local market dynamics and client expectations. 🌟🤝",
