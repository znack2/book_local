Key insights include: starting where regulations favor your business model can provide competitive advantages; customer-driven product development often beats elaborate pre-planning; remote operations are possible but local expertise remains crucial; cultural differences significantly impact service adoption even within seemingly similar markets; SME markets require efficient distribution models - either marketplace approach, hyperlocal focus, or strong partnerships; and scaling too broadly too quickly can dilute resources - focus beats spread in early expansion phases."

Estonia proved to be an excellent starting point 🎯.\n\nBefore Enty, we had worked on a crypto project called Tokenomic that involved tokenized securities 💰. While searching for the right regulatory framework, we tested various jurisdictions including Malta 🇲🇹 and offshore locations before discovering Estonia's flexible approach 📋.\n\nWe initially interacted with Estonia as clients - opening legal entities there ourselves and helping others do the same 🤝. We saw that there is reliability and demand in this market from people who speak English 🗣️. Secondly, we saw that it is possible to compete in this market and grab a share of it 📊.\n\nA market where there is constant demand 📈, where people are willing to communicate in English 🌐, and where we were able to do good business, of course 💼.\n\nThis gave us confidence to establish our business there by the end of 2020 ✅.",

So, there were no deadlines, because we had money at the beginning 💰. The first investors provided funding that should have been enough for five months. During that time, we had to do our first pre-seed round. In the end, we had enough money for nine or ten months ⏰. We didn't do it, but it became clear that something was working ✅.\n\nOur initial strategy was like: we aimed to find traction with real customers 👥, understand their pain points better, secure funding 💸, make a round and then implement this vision in reality. Originally, we envisioned building a platform similar to \"Carta\" in the US 🇺🇸 - a private equity management solution for handling cap tables, ESOP programs, and eventually creating a secondary market for private company shares 📊. But reality took us in a different direction! 🔄\n\nWhen we started talking to customers 💬, we discovered they weren't startup founders obsessed with equity management and capital markets. Most were ordinary business owners focused on making money and growing steadily 📈 - they had no ambition to become billion-dollar companies 🚀.\n\nThis led to our first conceptual pivot 🔄. Instead of an equity management platform, we shifted to solving the mundane back-office problems that entrepreneurs struggled with: navigating relationships between different processes, services, and contractors who all spoke different languages 🗣️. We wanted to bring all of this together under one roof 🏠.\n\nWe couldn't raise any money 💸, even with our initial traction. We had a cool pitch, we won awards 🏆, but no round happened, so we kept struggling here.",

This was our approach in Estonia 🇪🇪, and then we expanded through referrals, organic customers, and partnerships 🤝.\n\nThis approach is necessary because our business model serves small and medium enterprises (SMEs) with 2-25 employees 👥. These clients cannot afford to pay €1,000+ monthly 💰, which means our average revenue per client is relatively low. With such economics, we can't afford lengthy partnership negotiations or expensive sales processes 📈. We simply don't know how a startup will survive for two years ⏰. But we need to understand whether we are going in the right direction or not 🧭. Our B2B SME segment operates more like B2C - the customers are small and don't pay much, so we need efficient acquisition channels 🔄.\n\nWhy focus on non-residents? Local Estonians generally don't need our help 🤷‍♂️ - they can open companies themselves through government services and typically know lawyers or legal experts personally 👨‍💼. Plus, it's a tiny market: only about 25,000 companies open in Estonia annually 📊, with approximately 30-35% opened by people living abroad 🌍. Despite the small size of the market, it is still quite competitive 🏁. There were already established players with serious rounds of funding 💸, some of whom have now successfully entered other markets, both European and non-European. One of our competitors has even entered Brazil 🇧🇷.\n\nBut at the same time, in a year and a half, we saw that in our niche of opening companies for non-residents 🎯, we are already in the top three 🥉. And this is a great start overall 🚀, because no matter how our expansion plans go, whether we can find one market, or two, or three, or five 🌐, our Estonian business is already a business 💼. Yes, it's not huge, yes, you'll never become a billion-dollar company in Estonia alone 🇪🇪, but it's a base that has allowed us, our users, to build a product and generate good revenue 💰.",

That is, everything that cannot be done automatically, we pass on to this law firm, and they pay us a commission for referring the client to them 💰.\n\nInterestingly, I personally didn't visit Estonia until 2022 ✈️, about two years after launching the business there. My physical absence didn't hinder our operations at all 🚫.\n\nAlso I have to mention here where the customers come from 🌍.\n\nWhen we started, we didn't know exactly who was opening companies in Estonia 🤷‍♂️, but we quickly realized that the core demand was coming from Europeans from highly regulated countries. Central Europe — that's Germany 🇩🇪, which is the absolute leader, Italy 🇮🇹, Spain 🇪🇸 and France 🇫🇷, of course. And everyone else is scattered all over the world 🌐, really.\n\nAt one point, we had significant client bases from the CIS 🌍. However, when the war started ⚔️, people from these countries could no longer obtain e-resident cards (electronic signatures required to open companies) 💳. For Ukrainians 🇺🇦, special programs were created to help them start businesses - we even offer programs that compensate Ukrainians for company setup costs 💙💛.\n\nWhile the exclusion of some CIS countries reduced the overall market size 📉, it didn't significantly impact our business specifically 📊.",

Our vision was always to free entrepreneurs from boring office routines across Europe 🌍, not just in Estonia.\n\nBuilding sophisticated automation for such a small market didn't make economic sense 💰, so expansion was essential. Our initial plan was to cover all of Europe 🌍, but we realized we couldn't launch everywhere simultaneously with our current product and capabilities 🚫.\n\nWe chose a scaling model through service sales and a marketplace approach 🏪, with self-service tools available in our main product (the \"control panel\" 🎮). The challenge was that accounting services are very jurisdiction-specific - you can't simply offer accounting across all countries due to different rules, tax systems, and licensing requirements 📋. Some places even require a license for this. In general, it's complicated, impossible 🤯. So we decided that we needed to choose one country and go there. And in general, this is what we have heard from investors 💰: we are not giving up on our long-term ambitions, because our ambition was to build an automated product 🤖. To build an automated product, you need to invest in development right now, and that requires a little bit of money 💸. We heard some great figures in Estonia. The idea is great, it's clear 💡. It doesn't need to be proven. But show us that you can tap into the solvent demand of large markets 📊. So we went to prove ourselves to investors in the Netherlands 🇳🇱.\n\nWhy the Netherlands? 🤔\n1. The Netherlands has one of the highest English proficiency rates in continental Europe 🗣️\n2. The UK seemed too competitive (with similar startups already operating there) 🇬🇧\n3. The US was too distant and unfamiliar 🇺🇸\n\nLet's say, we were able to get started in the Netherlands in 1.5 months ⏰, we were able to start great sales in 3 months 📈, so we can do it anywhere (In Italy 🇮🇹, Spain 🇪🇸, and elsewhere). You just need to create a little more local substance to do that 🏗️. That was the plan, and it was carried out in full ✅.

So, based on the fact that accounting is the biggest pain 😣, we decided to sell through accounting. It's easy to sell through the biggest pain 💡. It sounded logical in theory. In addition to paid search on a commission basis for accounting services 💰, we also launched companies aimed at getting users to start using our tools in the control panel for free 🆓, as a premium feature. And then we would upsell them our accounting services 📈.\n\nUnfortunately, reality proved more complex 🤯. We allocated 4-5 months for this market entry ⏰. We didn't have any more time, and we thought that the money would run out and we would have to scale back our ambitions 💸. But the money kept appearing and the Estonian business continued to grow 📈, bringing us more and more money. In the end, we probably spent a total of nine months in the Netherlands 🇳🇱 before we figured out what to do next.\n\nWhy didn't it work out? 🤔 We tried different strategies. We started trying to sell in Dutch 🗣️. But globally, we encountered two things.\n\nFirst, we were completely unknown as a provider of accounting services 🤷‍♂️ (it turned out that accounting is an extremely sensitive matter 😰). You're not ready to trust some obscure Estonian dudes 🇪🇪, even with fancy landing pages 💻, with something as serious as your taxation 💰. You'd rather pay €300 to the guy next door 👨‍💼, who you can have tea with ☕ and who did your grandfather's and father's accounting 👴.\n\nYou don't care, but you're afraid of the Dutch tax authorities 😨, and you're probably right. That's the biggest mistake ❌. We underestimated the complexity of accounting as a service for sale. We managed to sell almost exclusively to expats 🌍 who didn't have such strong connections with local providers. And we realized that expats are a dead end for our quasi-business model 🚫.\n\nOur last attempt in the Netherlands was to disable accounting sales altogether 🚫 and put Paymall on all the features we had, such as Assel Service, which we had, we had an investment 💰, we had contract management 📝, and we had electronic signatures ✍️. And that was it, and we started selling it just as a SaaS product 💻. And people started buying it 💰. We made some 60-70 sales 📊. We basically just switched the offering but didn't make any changes to the product itself 🔄. And when we saw the sales, we realized that it was selling well overall 📈. Our soft service UI was selling and we could try selling it not only in the Netherlands but also in other regions 🌍.",

We realized our automated tools had potential as a straightforward SaaS product 💻 that could work across multiple European countries 🌍. Rather than focusing exclusively on the Dutch market 🇳🇱, it made more sense to distribute our investment across as many potential customers as possible 📊.\n\nSo earlier this year (around April/May) 📅, we took a short break ✋, adjusted our product to sell tools rather than accounting services 🔧, and launched Enty across Europe for all European customers 🇪🇺.\n\nThe product is largely the same across markets 📦. A few months ago, we added localizations for German 🇩🇪, French 🇫🇷, and Spanish 🇪🇸, but initially we offered only English 🗣️. From an economic perspective, distributing fixed costs across a large market makes sense 💰, but from a marketing standpoint, it's extremely challenging 📈. We're heating up a \"huge lake\" 🌊 that's difficult to warm with our limited resources 🔥.\n\nSo, long story short, this pan-European strategy hasn't been wildly successful either 📉 - we have sales, but growth is slow and expensive 💸. We're now rebuilding our model to focus on European user acquisition through affiliates 🤝. The product is great 👍, we built it well.

You asked me to give my summary of mistakes and lessons learned 🎓.\n\nLooking back at our journey 👀, I believe our decisions were dictated by circumstances and logic - we're not ashamed of them 💪, even if some seem naive in hindsight 🤷‍♂️. Of course, I wouldn't even have tried to sell an account in the Netherlands if I had known how it would turn out 🇳🇱. Of course, I would have invested in a slightly new pipeline from the very beginning 🔄. My team and I would have made the products in a different order 📊, distributed our efforts differently within the company 🏢, and we wouldn't have made some products at all, because we are building an all-in-one solution 🛠️. I would be a little less aggressive 😤, maybe spend less money on testing hypotheses across Europe 💸 if I knew what the results would be. In general, knowing the results, it's easy not to do 80% of what we did 📉. But knowing the results, I would have done pretty much the same thing ✅.\n\nThree major lessons: 📖\n\n1. Never enter the SME market without a clear distribution model 🎯. You need either a marketplace approach 🏪, hyperlocal focus on a specific niche in a specific jurisdiction 📍, or strong partnerships that bring customers 🤝. Building acquisition channels from scratch takes too long ⏰, and paid channels are prohibitively expensive for the SME segment 💸.\n\n2. Try to sell first, then build the product 💰➡️🛠️. This is challenging with self-service products but crucial ⚡. With enterprise clients, you can sell while developing 🏢, but SMEs require ready solutions 📦. I would be more aggressive in selling to partners to establish acquisition channels 🚀.\n\n3. Don't underestimate cultural differences 🌍. There is no unified Europe in practice - Germans buy from Germans 🇩🇪, French buy from French 🇫🇷. Everyone buys from Americans 🇺🇸, but Europeans rarely buy cross-country services 🚫. Estonia has limited brand recognition 🇪🇪. These specificities matter greatly when offering services rather than pure software products 💻.\n\nI still believe that true software products can be global from day one 🌍. Collaboration tools like Miro, for example, don't need to be localized extensively because everyone uses them the same way 🎨. We aspired to move in that direction but remained closer to the service side 🛠️, where local presence matters tremendously 📍.",
