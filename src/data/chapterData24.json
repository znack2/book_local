Let me share our rather serendipitous journey. 🌟\n\nOur entry into India was largely accidental. It began when Misha Mikhno, founder of <a href=\"https://maximum.education\">Maximum Education</a>, was organizing international expeditions. He had traveled to China frequently and posted on Facebook about attending a conference in India. We asked to join him, coincidentally around the same time we were raising a round from <a href=\"https://corp.mail.ru\">Mail.ru</a>. This was right before COVID, during a period when many startups were exploring international opportunities. 📱\n\nWe arrived in Delhi for the conference, networked with attendees, and continued socializing outside the formal events. Through these interactions, we realized there was significant potential for our business model in India. We recognized that we spoke the \"same language\" with the local professionals, and the market dynamics seemed familiar enough to navigate. 🤝\n\nOnly after deciding to pursue India did we develop a rational justification: it's an English-speaking market where education is highly valued, particularly engineering education. India represents one of the foundational markets for global education. Surprisingly, we've never seriously considered other countries or conducted comprehensive comparative analysis. We simply followed our instinct after seeing an opportunity firsthand. 💡",

When we first entered India, we took quite a naive approach. 😅\n\nWe started by simply copying our local website, translating it to English, and launching digital advertising. Our initial metrics seemed promising - leads were approximately 50 times cheaper than at home, which created temporary excitement. However, within a month, we had made zero sales, which was quite sobering. 😬\n\nWhile we initially targeted all of India, we quickly discovered this wasn't effective. India has distinct market tiers - Tier 1 cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) and Tier 2 cities (like Pune) generate vastly different results. When we refined our targeting to these urban centers, lead quality dramatically improved. The broader regions produced irrelevant leads from people with inadequate English skills or insufficient purchasing power. 🏙️\n\nOur strategy in India initially mirrored our common approach. This stemmed from a rather arrogant assumption that we were simply smarter than local competitors. We believed we had developed a perfect playbook at home that just needed to be implemented in India. This confidence made it very difficult for us to abandon this mindset even when faced with contradictory evidence. 🧠",

      "body": "You asked about when we started questioning our approach and what triggered our shift in strategy. Our confidence was seriously challenged during our first extended business trip to India. 🛫\n\nWhen we visited Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore purposefully to meet with serious market players, we were stunned by what we found. These weren't the unsophisticated operators we had imagined - they were highly intelligent, advanced professionals running businesses much larger than ours. It became immediately obvious that our plan to revolutionize the market with our \"superior\" marketing techniques was fundamentally flawed. 🤯\n\nFor example, we initially observed that many educational providers weren't using paid advertising in Delhi. We incorrectly assumed this meant they didn't understand digital marketing. In reality, they were targeting a different market segment entirely - university graduates seeking reskilling opportunities. This segment doesn't exist at the same scale at home due to our relatively healthy labor market and different educational system. 🎓\n\nThe Indian higher education landscape is drastically different from our local one. In India, there's an extreme hierarchy: top universities (like IITs) have incredible competition with tens of thousands of applicants per spot, while Tier 3 institutions offer paid degrees that often lead nowhere professionally. This creates a massive market for supplementary education and skills development that simply doesn't exist at home. 📚\n\nAdditionally, the job market dynamics are completely different. In India, any job posting receives hundreds of applications immediately, many from unqualified candidates desperate for work. This creates significant demand for affordable courses that promise employability, which local providers were already serving effectively through non-digital channels. 💼",

After our first unsuccessful month with zero sales, we completely restructured our approach. 🔧\n\nWe rebuilt our product, added a job guarantee program, lowered prices, and implemented webinar-based sales. To address trust issues (which we found were much higher in India than at home), we created a certificate program that encouraged reviews, positioning testimonials differently, and ensured our webinars featured foreign instructors to build credibility. 🎯\n\nSales capability proved crucial. We fired our initial representative Sandeep (hired from <a href=\"https://upwork.com\">Upwork</a>) and recruited experienced sales professionals who had worked at established Indian educational companies. Having team members who understood the local sales dynamics made an enormous difference. 💪\n\nOur team structure evolved gradually. Initially, just two of us (myself and Sasha) managed everything - building the website, running advertising, and conducting sales calls ourselves. We maintained this lean approach until securing our first sales. Once we had validation, we began registering a proper legal entity. ⚖️\n\nFor our market testing, we favored rapid experimentation over extensive research. Rather than spending months on desk research and customer interviews, we implemented changes quickly, observed results, and adjusted accordingly. This approach allowed us to fail fast and find what worked through rapid iteration cycles. ⚡\n\nTrust-building became a central focus. Indian customers were far more skeptical than our local ones - they would question why our IP name didn't match our domain, send relatives to verify our physical office location, and thoroughly investigate our credentials before purchasing. This required a completely different approach to establishing credibility. 🔍",

This aspect proved particularly challenging. 🤔\n\nWe quickly learned that our local management styles don't work in India - in fact, they don't work well anywhere outside home. The most critical insight was that we couldn't effectively operate with a mixed international team. We needed to build a fully Indian operation. 🇮🇳\n\nThe cultural differences were substantial. Even highly skilled Indian professionals typically expected daily direction and supervision rather than autonomous work. When our manager told the Indian team, \"I don't care about lead quality; I care about conversion rates,\" they were completely baffled by this communication style. 🗣️\n\nOur early team expansion focused on product and marketing roles. For substantial positions, we initially hired people from our country, which proved problematic. Having Raina (a team member who lived in India) was beneficial, but most of our current team hires had no understanding of India, creating significant challenges. 🌍\n\nWe attempted to work with local agencies but found their performance disappointing and quickly shifted to building in-house capabilities. The one exception was our back-office functions (legal, accounting, payments), where we found a reliable Indian agency that supported us throughout our operations. 📋\n\nThe student culture also differed dramatically. Indian students communicated extensively with each other, forming tight-knit communities. Before purchasing a course, prospective students would typically contact 5-6 existing students through <a href=\"https://linkedin.com\">LinkedIn</a> or other channels - something almost unimaginable at home. Once enrolled, students would call each other daily and become close friends. 📞\n\nInterestingly, we discovered that stricter deadlines and requirements actually improved retention and results. While we initially thought supportive, caring follow-up would boost completion rates, we found that setting firm boundaries and consequences for missing deadlines was far more effective in motivating students. ⏰",

      "body": "You inquired about when we reached financial stability and what eventually led to our closure. Our financial journey was quite a rollercoaster. 🎢\n\nAfter several iterations, we began seeing promising results by summer. While we weren't yet profitable, our unit economics were improving. At this point, we raised our first investment round, giving us runway to continue growing. 📈\n\nThe real breakthrough came when we implemented influencer marketing. This channel performed extraordinarily well, with ROI reaching up to 1000% because nobody else in India was using this approach effectively. We had to replace our entire marketing team to make this happen, as the original team didn't believe in this strategy despite our leadership's conviction. 🚀\n\nThis success led to another funding round as our economics looked strong. At our peak, we reached monthly revenues of $600,000-$700,000 and had approximately 100 people on our sales team alone. However, this growth proved unsustainable. 📊\n\nAs competitors entered the influencer marketing space, our exceptional results normalized. Meanwhile, we never achieved consistent performance on other channels like <a href=\"https://google.com\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://facebook.com\">Facebook</a>. The influencer channel that had driven our growth began declining, and we couldn't recover even at reduced volumes. 📉\n\nWe spent considerable time trying to diagnose and fix the problem but ultimately concluded that our product-market fit had simply disappeared. The channel that had temporarily made our economics work was no longer performing exceptionally, revealing that our underlying product and brand weren't sufficiently differentiated. 💔\n\nThis experience fundamentally changed my perspective on marketing-driven growth. I now believe you can't build a sustainable company through marketing excellence alone - you need genuine product-market fit reflected in retention metrics and organic growth. Great marketing can help scale a business, but it can't compensate for product shortcomings. ⚖️",

      "body": "You asked about the key mistakes we made and the lessons we've taken from this experience. Let me share our most important realizations. 💭\n\nOur first major mistake was arrogance - believing we were smarter than local competitors and that our expertise would automatically translate to India. India isn't a \"donor\" country that passively consumes foreign products; it's a highly competitive market with hungry, tech-savvy professionals who can execute effectively at lower costs. Often, they're simply better than foreign entrants. 🇮🇳\n\nSecond, we scaled prematurely without finding true product-market fit. Instead of experimenting with small groups to identify optimal outcomes and customer segments, we immediately invested heavily in performance marketing with a mediocre product. We should have grown more gradually, ensuring we had found our ideal customer segment before scaling. 📏\n\nOperationally, we were slow to recognize the need for a fully Indian team and the unique dynamics of the Indian market. We also failed to appreciate the limitations of performance marketing in this context. 🔧\n\nMy greatest takeaway is the importance of genuine product value. A truly great product should generate some form of organic acquisition - either through free users, virality, or exceptional word-of-mouth. Without this engine, you're essentially trying to \"bark at a closed door\" with expensive marketing. 🚪\n\nThe reliance on paid acquisition creates cascading problems: it forces a higher average price point, often leading to installment payments and unhappy customers who feel trapped. Yet many entrepreneurs struggle to think beyond this model, limiting themselves to questions about optimizing <a href=\"https://facebook.com\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://google.com\">Google</a> ads rather than addressing fundamental product issues. 🔄\n\nIn conclusion, I've completely reversed my thinking. I started as a marketing-driven entrepreneur who believed great marketing could sell anything. Now I believe the opposite - marketing can help capture existing demand, but you can't build a great company without solving real customer problems that drive retention and organic growth. 🎯",
