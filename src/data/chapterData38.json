      "description": "Andrew Luchkin's systematic approach to getstage's international expansion demonstrates the importance of thorough research and methodical execution in entering new markets. Key insights include: conducting comprehensive global market research before committing to any single market, the value of systematic product development phases with regular investor check-ins, the critical importance of maintaining direct control over core functions like performance marketing, the risks of relying on single-source agencies without backup options, and the necessity of building local teams for cultural understanding while maintaining centralized oversight of technical functions. getstage's experience shows that even well-researched market entry can face execution challenges, emphasizing the need for contingency planning and the balance between local expertise and centralized control in international expansion strategies."

Unlike many companies that start in their home market and then expand, we took a more global approach from the beginning.\n\nWe first spent about five months developing our product concept 💡. Our investors were clear from the start that they wanted to build a global product rather than focusing on CIS. After finalizing the product concept, we conducted thorough market research across multiple continents.\n\nThe research process was comprehensive - we began by examining regions globally, and then narrowed down to specific countries based on relevant characteristics for our video platform 🌍. We analyzed market data extensively and ultimately narrowed our focus to a handful of promising markets. Brazil emerged as one of our top three options, along with some countries in Africa.\n\nWe ultimately chose Brazil because it had a larger audience, more money in the market, and felt more understandable to us based on our analysis 🇧🇷. Though Africa showed certain advantages for product growth, we trusted the Brazilian market more for our initial launch.\n\nInterestingly, when making this decision, none of our team members had actually visited Brazil 🤔. We planned to hire a Brazilian team later in the process, closer to our launch date.",

During this period, our main task was to develop a product concept that our investors would believe in and continue funding 💰. This wasn't about testing the market yet - it was about defining what we wanted to build based on our expertise in video technology.\n\nWe started with broad exploration across B2B and B2C segments 🔍. The first month focused on high-level analysis to understand different potential directions, considering our team's expertise and investor interests. By month two, we had narrowed our focus to B2C, exploring areas like video reviews, interactive videos, and content monetization.\n\nIn months three and four, we scored our findings, developed specific ideas, and conducted preliminary surveys across about ten countries 📊. These weren't comprehensive market studies but rather initial validation of potential problems our product could solve.\n\nThroughout this process, we had regular meetings with investors - not just at the end of the five months 🤝. These biweekly or triweekly meetings helped us iterate and focus on directions that showed promise.\n\nOnly after selecting our product concept did we move to the second stage - detailed market research to determine where to launch 🎯. This second stage also took about five months, during which we built more sophisticated models based on reliable data and began working with analysts to develop our business approach.",

Some key technical components needed to be developed from scratch since no suitable solutions existed in the market.\n\nI joined early as a project manager/researcher, brought on because of my experience with case studies and market analysis 📊. Initially, there was no dedicated research or analytics team - I handled those responsibilities based on my previous experience launching new directions.\n\nDuring our second stage, we added analysts to help build our business model using the data we'd collected 📈. We gathered extensive information by parsing social networks and conducting quantitative surveys to understand metrics like average broadcast length and preferred monetization models.\n\nDevelopment continued in parallel with our research 🔄. Rather than create a minimal viable product (MVP), we aimed for what we called a Minimal Lovable Product (MLP) - something polished enough to avoid negative first impressions. This approach required more initial development time but would potentially yield better feedback.\n\nWe eventually built out a complete product for iOS, Android, and web platforms before our test launch 📱.",

The third stage of our project involved testing specific features for the Brazilian market and establishing relationships with the partners we'd identified.\n\nBy the end of the second stage, we had finalized our market selection, business model, integration plans, and had a clear understanding of what needed to be done to launch successfully in Brazil ✅.",

We aimed to launch to approximately 1,000 users for a four-month test period from September to December ⏰. This lengthy test period was intentional - we needed sufficient time for users to fully experience the platform, including activities that naturally take several weeks, such as setting up custom domains or building an audience.\n\nWorking with an agency, we planned to onboard users gradually: 150 people in the first two weeks of September, another 150 in the second half of September, and so on 📈. This staggered approach allowed us to manage the process effectively and gather feedback at different stages of the user journey.\n\nThe goal wasn't just product testing - we wanted to build a pool of ambassadors who could potentially continue collaborating with us after the full launch 🤝. During this period, we conducted over 80 interviews and multiple surveys to refine our understanding of user needs.\n\nFollowing this test phase, we allocated December and January for product refinements based on user feedback 🔧.

These events followed a structured format: first featuring an influencer-expert speaking on a topic related to our product (such as content monetization), followed by a product presentation, and concluding with an open Q&A session and networking time.\n\nThese events served multiple purposes: confirming our legitimacy as a company, motivating active users, generating social media content, and building our brand presence 📱. We typically invited the most engaged users, with around 50 attendees per event being sufficient for our objectives.\n\nWe held monthly events during the test phase, all in São Paulo 🇧🇷. Each event cost approximately $5,000-10,000, depending on the number of attendees. The budget covered venue rental, refreshments, influencer fees, and invitations. Our agency handled all logistics and follow-up, maintaining relationships with attendees to encourage continued platform usage.\n\nFor video production, we created short FAQ videos for our landing page and product explanations, with budgets of a few thousand dollars monthly for these content pieces 🎬.",

We had contracted a Brazilian marketing agency to handle creative materials, banners, and the landing page built on Webflow. We chose an external agency rather than using our in-house designers because we wanted local expertise for proper localization and cultural nuances.\n\nUnfortunately, when we finally launched, our Brazilian marketing team struggled to quickly gain traction 📉. The advertising campaigns were poorly optimized, and despite our attempts to help them improve, they repeatedly failed to implement our suggestions. After multiple unsuccessful attempts to salvage the situation, we realized we needed to take direct control.\n\nBy April, we began searching for marketing agencies capable of launching campaigns in Brazil 🔍. This was presented as a \"research team\" initiative to find specific connections before handing off to larger-scale marketing efforts. We ultimately engaged two different agencies, splitting a $10,000 monthly budget between them. Interestingly, we found that running parallel campaigns through different agencies didn't cause competition issues - the audience segmentation worked effectively.\n\nThese efforts helped us correct the course, but we still missed our May 1st targets because the previous ineffective Brazilian campaigns had trained the algorithms on irrelevant audiences 🤖.

After the May 1st milestone when we didn't reach our targets, we actually downsized rather than expanded 📉. The Brazilian marketing director was let go for failing to meet commitments. We continued working through agencies until November when we finally hired a full-time performance manager, as our growing marketing budgets made this more cost-effective than continuing with agency fees.\n\nOur technical solutions extended beyond the website 🔍. We tested numerous marketing channels including Meta, Google, TikTok, Bing, and LinkedIn to identify the most effective platforms for our audience. This broad approach allowed us to gather data across multiple channels without requiring massive budgets for each test.\n\nBy August, we had significantly improved our cost metrics for paying customers, bringing them to the level we had originally projected for February 📈.

We aimed for about 30% of our user base to be paying for at least two months by that milestone date.\n\nWhen we didn't reach these targets due to marketing execution problems, we had to reassess 🔄. After taking over the marketing efforts ourselves, we presented a revised plan with more realistic figures, reducing our targets by approximately 80%. This adjustment came after discovering that our total addressable market in the Brazilian influencer space was actually much smaller than initially estimated - only about 200,000-300,000 users who created chargeable content that matched our target audience.\n\nOur sixth stage targets for September 1st were similarly focused on subscription and revenue metrics, but with these more realistic expectations 🎯. However, we encountered another challenge: the advertising algorithms had been trained on irrelevant traffic from previous campaigns, making our conversion costs artificially low but actually bringing in the wrong users.\n\nWhen we restarted our marketing in July, we saw that our true customer acquisition costs were much higher than previously calculated 📈. If only 10% of your traffic is relevant, your actual conversion cost is 10 times what you're measuring. This realization led us to completely reset our marketing approach.\n\nBy late July, we finally began seeing promising results with paying customers, bringing our acquisition costs down to levels we had originally projected for February 🎉.

Having a Brazilian team was crucial for understanding cultural nuances, building credibility, and managing local partnerships. However, we should have maintained more direct control over technical marketing functions.\n\nOur agency selection process was also flawed 🤔. For the initial user acquisition agency, we essentially went with the only option we could find that was willing to take on our specific requirements. This lack of alternatives left us vulnerable when performance didn't meet expectations.\n\nThe staged approach to funding and development worked well overall 📈. Regular investor meetings kept us focused and accountable, while the iterative budget process allowed us to adjust based on learnings. However, we probably should have been more aggressive about testing marketing approaches earlier in the process.\n\nLooking back, the combination of strong technical product development with systematic market research created a solid foundation 🏗️. The execution challenges were primarily in areas where we relied too heavily on external partners without sufficient oversight or alternative options.\n\nThese experiences shaped our understanding of international market entry and the balance between local expertise and centralized control over critical business functions ⚖️.",
