He had traveled to China frequently and posted on Facebook about attending a conference in India. We asked to join him, coincidentally around the same time we were raising a round from Mail.ru. **This was right before COVID, during a period when many Russian startups were exploring international opportunities.**\n\n**We arrived in Delhi for the conference, networked with attendees, and continued socializing outside the formal events.** Through these interactions, we realized there was significant potential for our business model in India. **We recognized that we spoke the 'same language' with the local professionals we met, and the market dynamics seemed familiar enough to navigate.**\n\n**Only after deciding to pursue India did we develop a rational justification:** it's an English-speaking market where education is highly valued, particularly engineering education. India represents one of the foundational markets for global education. **Surprisingly, we never seriously considered other countries or conducted comprehensive comparative analysis. We simply followed our instinct after seeing an opportunity firsthand.**",

      "body": "**When we first entered India, we took quite a naive approach.** We started by simply copying our Russian website, translating it to English, and launching digital advertising. **Our initial metrics seemed promising - leads were approximately 50 times cheaper than in Russia,** which created temporary excitement. **However, within a month, we had made zero sales,** which was quite sobering.\n\n**While we initially targeted all of India, we quickly discovered this wasn't effective.** India has distinct market tiers - Tier 1 cities (Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore) and Tier 2 cities (like Pune) generate vastly different results. **When we refined our targeting to these urban centers, lead quality dramatically improved.** The broader regions produced irrelevant leads from people with inadequate English skills or insufficient purchasing power.\n\n**Our strategy in India initially mirrored our Russian approach.** This stemmed from a rather arrogant assumption that we were simply smarter than local competitors. **We believed we had developed a perfect playbook in Russia that just needed to be implemented in India.** This confidence made it very difficult for us to abandon this mindset even when faced with contradictory evidence.",

      "body": "**Our confidence was seriously challenged during our first extended business trip to India.** When we visited Delhi, Mumbai, and Bangalore purposefully to meet with serious market players, **we were stunned by what we found. These weren't the unsophisticated operators we had imagined - they were highly intelligent, advanced professionals running businesses much larger than ours.** It became immediately obvious that our plan to revolutionize the market with our 'superior' marketing techniques was fundamentally flawed.\n\n**For example, we initially observed that many educational providers weren't using paid advertising in Delhi. We incorrectly assumed this meant they didn't understand digital marketing.** In reality, they were targeting a different market segment entirely - university graduates seeking reskilling opportunities. **This segment doesn't exist at the same scale in Russia due to our relatively healthy labor market and different educational system.**\n\n**The Indian higher education landscape is drastically different from Russia's.** In India, there's an extreme hierarchy: **top universities (like IITs) have incredible competition with tens of thousands of applicants per spot, while Tier 3 institutions offer paid degrees that often lead nowhere professionally.** This creates a massive market for supplementary education and skills development that simply doesn't exist in Russia.",

      "body": "**After our first unsuccessful month with zero sales, we completely restructured our approach.** We rebuilt our product, added a job guarantee program, lowered prices, and implemented webinar-based sales. **To address trust issues (which we found were much higher in India than Russia),** we created a certificate program that encouraged reviews, positioning testimonials differently, and ensured our webinars featured foreign instructors to build credibility.\n\n**Sales capability proved crucial.** We fired our initial representative Sandeep (hired from Upwork) and recruited experienced sales professionals who had worked at established Indian educational companies. **Having team members who understood the local sales dynamics made an enormous difference.**\n\nOur team structure evolved gradually. Initially, just two of us (myself and Sasha) managed everything - building the website, running advertising, and conducting sales calls ourselves. **We maintained this lean approach until securing our first sales.** Once we had validation, we began registering a proper legal entity.\n\n**For our market testing, we favored rapid experimentation over extensive research.** Rather than spending months on desk research and customer interviews, we implemented changes quickly, observed results, and adjusted accordingly. **This approach allowed us to fail fast and find what worked through rapid iteration cycles.**\n\n**Trust-building became a central focus. Indian customers were far more skeptical than Russians** - they would question why our IP name didn't match our domain, send relatives to verify our physical office location, and thoroughly investigate our credentials before purchasing.",

We needed to build a fully Indian operation.**\n\n**The cultural differences were substantial.** Even highly skilled Indian professionals typically expected daily direction and supervision rather than autonomous work. **When our Russian manager told the Indian team, 'I don't care about lead quality; I care about conversion rates,' they were completely baffled by this communication style.**\n\nOur early team expansion focused on product and marketing roles. For substantial positions, we initially hired Russians, which proved problematic. **Having Raina (a team member who lived in India) was beneficial, but most of our Russian hires had no understanding of India,** creating significant challenges.\n\n**We attempted to work with local agencies but found their performance disappointing** and quickly shifted to building in-house capabilities. The one exception was our back-office functions (legal, accounting, payments), where we found a reliable Indian agency that supported us throughout our operations.\n\n**The student culture also differed dramatically from Russia.** Indian students communicated extensively with each other, forming tight-knit communities. **Before purchasing a course, prospective students would typically contact 5-6 existing students through LinkedIn or other channels** - something almost unimaginable in Russia. Once enrolled, students would call each other daily and become close friends.",

      "body": "After several iterations, we began seeing promising results by summer. **While we weren't yet profitable, our unit economics were improving.** At this point, we raised our first investment round, giving us runway to continue growing.\n\n**The real breakthrough came when we implemented influencer marketing.** This channel performed extraordinarily well, **with ROI reaching up to 1000% because nobody else in India was using this approach effectively.** We had to replace our entire marketing team to make this happen, as the original team didn't believe in this strategy despite our leadership's conviction.\n\n**This success led to another funding round as our economics looked strong. At our peak, we reached monthly revenues of $600,000-$700,000 and had approximately 100 people on our sales team alone.** However, this growth proved unsustainable.\n\n**As competitors entered the influencer marketing space, our exceptional results normalized.** Meanwhile, we never achieved consistent performance on other channels like Google and Facebook. **The influencer channel that had driven our growth began declining, and we couldn't recover even at reduced volumes.**\n\nWe spent considerable time trying to diagnose and fix the problem but ultimately concluded that **our product-market fit had simply disappeared.** The channel that had temporarily made our economics work was no longer performing exceptionally, revealing that our underlying product and brand weren't sufficiently differentiated.\n\n**This experience fundamentally changed my perspective on marketing-driven growth. I now believe you can't build a sustainable company through marketing excellence alone** - you need genuine product-market fit reflected in retention metrics and organic growth.",

      "body": "**Our first major mistake was arrogance** - believing we were smarter than local competitors and that our Russian expertise would automatically translate to India. **India isn't a 'donor' country that passively consumes foreign products; it's a highly competitive market with hungry, tech-savvy professionals who can execute effectively at lower costs.** Often, they're simply better than foreign entrants.\n\n**Second, we scaled prematurely without finding true product-market fit.** Instead of experimenting with small groups to identify optimal outcomes and customer segments, we immediately invested heavily in performance marketing with a mediocre product. **We should have grown more gradually, ensuring we had found our ideal customer segment before scaling.**\n\n**The job guarantee feature also proved problematic,** attracting the wrong audience - 'free riders' who expected to receive training without genuinely committing to the work required. This created ongoing challenges with completion rates and job placement.\n\nOperationally, **we were slow to recognize the need for a fully Indian team and the unique dynamics of the Indian market.** We also failed to appreciate the limitations of performance marketing in this context.\n\n**My greatest takeaway is the importance of genuine product value. A truly great product should generate some form of organic acquisition** - either through free users, virality, or exceptional word-of-mouth. **Without this engine, you're essentially trying to 'bark at a closed door' with expensive marketing.**\n\n**The reliance on paid acquisition creates cascading problems:** it forces a higher average price point, often leading to installment payments and unhappy customers who feel trapped.\n\n**I've completely reversed my thinking.** I started as a marketing-driven entrepreneur who believed great marketing could sell anything. **Now I believe the opposite - marketing can help capture existing demand, but you can't build a great company without solving real customer problems that drive retention and organic growth.**",
